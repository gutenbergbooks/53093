 <h2>DIARY OF EVENTS AT LUCKNOW.</h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">For</span> about ten days previous to the outbreak, daily
reports were made that an <i>émeute</i> was intended, and
Sir H. M. Lawrence had ordered all kinds of stores
to be purchased and stored in the "Muchee
Bhawun" and the City Residency. But latterly
the intelligence began to excite less attention, as so
many days had passed away which had been named
for the outbreak. On the evening of the 30th May,
however, a sepoy of the 13th Native Infantry, who
had shortly before received a reward from Sir Henry
Lawrence for having assisted in the capture of a
spy, came to Captain Wilson of the 13th Native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
Infantry, Assistant Adjutant-General, and said he
could not help reporting that there would be a
rising amongst the sepoy regiments, to be commenced
in the lines of the 71st Native Infantry that
evening at about 8 or 9 <small>P.M.</small>; but he was not certain
at what hour. His manner in giving this information
was <i>earnest</i> and <i>impressive</i>.</p>

<p>On that evening everything went on as usual;
all remained quiet in the cantonments, where Sir
Henry Lawrence was residing. Some days previously
the ladies and children had been removed
to the Residency in the city, which place had
already been occupied by a party of the 32nd Foot
and two guns. The 9 <small>P.M.</small> gun was fired, and was
evidently the preconcerted signal for the mutiny;
for a few minutes after, whilst Sir Henry Lawrence
and his staff were at dinner at the Residency, a
sepoy came running in and reported a disturbance
in the lines. Two shots were heard in the 71st
lines. The horses of the staff were at once ordered,
and they proceeded to the lines. On the way, more
dropping shots were heard from the left of the 71st
lines. The party arrived in the camp, where about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
300 men of Her Majesty's 32nd, with four guns of
Major Kaye's battery, and two guns of the Oude
Irregular Force were posted, and found them all on
the alert. These were posted in a position on the
extreme right of the 71st lines (the whole front of
which they swept), and they were also contiguous to
the road leading from cantonments to the city.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence immediately took two guns
and a company of the 32nd with him on the road
leading to the town, and there took post; thereby
blocking up the road, and effectually cutting off all
access to the city. He sent back soon after for reinforcements
of the Europeans and for two more guns.
In the meantime, the officers of the several regiments
had proceeded at once to their respective
lines. Bands of insurgents had meanwhile made
their way amongst the officers' bungalows, keeping
up as they went a desultory fire, which prevented
many from passing the roads towards the lines.
One of the first of these parties made straight for
the mess house of the 71st Native Infantry, whence
the officers had escaped but a few minutes before.
They exhibited great bloodthirstiness, making every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
search for the officers, and ending by firing the
house. On several shots being fired from the
71st lines on the 32nd Foot and guns, the order
was given to open with grape; on which a rush was
made by the sepoys to the rear; when they passed
the infantry picket, which is situate in the centre of
cantonments. The picket was under the command
of Lieutenant Grant of the 71st Native Infantry.
His men remained with him till the mutineers were
close upon him. They then broke; but the subadar
of the guard, and some men of the 13th and 48th
Regiments, composing the guard, tried to save him
by placing him under a bed. A man of the 71st
Native Infantry, who was on guard with him, however,
discovered the place of his concealment to the
mutineers, and he was there brutally murdered&mdash;receiving
no less than fifteen bayonet wounds,
besides some from musket balls.</p>

<p>From the first, Lieutenant Hardinge, taking with
him some few sowars of his Irregular Cavalry,
patrolled up and down the main street of the cantonments,
and went to the officers' messes on the chance
of saving any lives. In the compound of the 71st
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
mess, he was fired at by a mutineer, who then rushed
upon him with his bayonet, which pierced his arm.
More than once the cantonments were thus patrolled
by Lieutenant Hardinge under a smart fire, with
the same humane intentions; but not in sufficient
force to prevent the burning and plundering of the
officers' bungalows, and of the bazaars. The excitement
in the lines continued; while the 32nd remained
quietly in position, awaiting the advent of
the remnants of the regiments who had remained
true to their colours. A remnant of the 13th Native
Infantry, about 200 men, with colours and treasure,
came up; and, according to previous arrangement,
joined and fell in on the right of the 32nd. A small
portion of the 71st, without being able to save their
colours or their treasure, (through the disaffection of
the native officer on duty,) also came up and took
post next the 32nd Foot. Of the 48th, nothing was
heard till 10 <small>A.M.</small> next day. About 10 o'clock <small>P.M.</small>
many of the mutineers had made their way up to
some empty artillery lines, outside the 71st Native
Infantry lines, whence they commenced firing.
Brigadier Handscomb, who had come up from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
rear of the 71st lines, was killed by a stray shot
from this place: just as he had reached the left
flank of the 32nd, he fell dead off his horse. The
bungalows throughout the cantonments were most
of them on fire. No attempt was subsequently
made to attack the position. To secure the Residency
bungalow, and that portion of the cantonment next
the city road, 4 guns and a company and a half
were taken up to the cantonment Residency, and the
guns placed at each gate. All was now quiet, and
the remainder of the night passed away without any
further event. Nothing had been seen or heard of
the 48th Native Infantry. Many officers had most
wonderful escapes from death. Lieutenant and
Adjutant Chambers of the 13th Native Infantry,
was severely wounded in the leg, whilst effecting his
escape from the magazine where he had taken a
guard of his regiment.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>May 31st.</i>&mdash;At daylight, the force, consisting of
some companies of Her Majesty's 32nd Foot, and
the remnants of the native regiments, about 100
men 71st, and 220 men 13th Native Infantry, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
part of the 7th Cavalry, and four guns, advanced
down the parade in front of the lines of the several
regiments. From the lines of the 13th Native
Infantry about fifty men came, and said they had
saved the magazine of that regiment. Hearing that
the body of the rebels had retired towards the race
course, where they had plundered the lines of the
7th Cavalry, and murdered Cornet Raleigh of that
regiment (who had been left there sick) the whole
force of cavalry and infantry, with four guns, proceeded
thither, leaving Colonel Case with a portion
of the 32nd in position in cantonments. On arriving
in the open plain, a body of about 1200 men
were seen in line in the distance, drawn up to the
race course. Many of the cavalry galloped over at
once to the insurgents. The guns then opened
with round shot, which dispersed them, and they
made the best of their way across country, followed
immediately by the cavalry and guns, and, at a
greater distance by the infantry. No opportunity
offered for the guns to again open, owing to the
celerity of their flight; but the cavalry hovered
round and took about sixty prisoners, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
brought into cantonments. The pursuit continued
in the same order until the guns were stopped by a
nullah, over which they could not cross. The
cavalry, however, continued their pursuit; and kept
it up for some ten miles. By 10 <small>A.M.</small> the force had
returned to cantonments, as the heat was excessive.</p>

<p>As most of the bungalows were burned (the
officers having lost everything) the troops were
moved into camp,&mdash;the 32nd and guns into the position
they held formerly; the native regiments next
them on the right; and in the following order:&mdash;13th
next the 32nd, the 71st next, then the 48th,
with the 7th Cavalry on the extreme right. The
usual guards were kept by the native regiments,
and the cantonments regularly occupied. Owing to
this, the neighbouring country seemed to be reassured.
Supplies came in regularly, and in plenty.
The exertions of all were redoubled to complete the
defences, and collect stores and supplies in Muchee
Bhawun and the city Residency. The former post,
originally occupied by the dependants of the late
king, had been selected by Sir Henry Lawrence as
a fitting place of security and retreat, in case matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
took an unfavourable turn. On the 16th of May,
immediately on the receipt of intelligence from
Meerut of the commencement of the outbreak, this
stronghold, then in a very dilapidated condition,
was occupied by the light company of the 13th and
some guns, and measures were taken for its thorough
cleansing. Supplies continued to be brought
in and stored.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which the troops
returned from the pursuit of the rebels, an insurrection
took place in the city towards Hosainabad;
the standard of the prophet was raised, and other
means of religious persuasion used to excite the
populace. The police of the city, under the energetic
superintendence of Captain Carnegie, behaved
well, and the movement was at once quelled, and
the standard taken. News of the <i>émeute</i> at this place
had by this time reached the district, and the rising
of the neighbouring stations was to be looked for.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 4th June, parties of
ladies and officers of the 41st Native Infantry,
escorted by about twenty-five men of the regiment,
who had remained faithful, came in, bringing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
news of the mutiny at Seetapore, and of the deaths
of Lieutenant-Colonel Birch, commanding the
regiment there, of Mr. Christian, and of other
civilians and ladies. On the 5th, news came of the
mutiny at Cawnpore, but no particulars. Reports
of all kinds were rife among the Bazaars; but no
authentic intelligence could be procured, as the
telegraph wire was cut. From Benares the news
came in of the 37th Native Infantry having mutinied,
and of their having been overpowered by
the rest of the force there. But nothing further
transpired, for from that day to the 10th instant,
the communication was <i>in toto</i> interrupted.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;The defences at the city Residency,
as well as the Muchee Bhawun, were increased,
and houses and buildings around them began at
once to be demolished. Large stacks of firewood
were made, and houses and tents set apart for the
occupation of the European refugees, who were
arriving from the districts daily. Provisions of all
sorts continued to be stored, including 110 hogsheads
of beer just arrived from Cawnpore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
Besides the two important posts noted above,
the range of buildings towards the Hosainabad
quarter of the town were occupied by 2000 police
under the direction of Captain Carnegie; a thousand
more were ordered to be raised, and officers of
the 41st were put in command of each of the police
battalions. This day we heard, by native report,
that General Wheeler was defending himself in the
entrenchments at Cawnpore; but no letter was
received.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 11th.</i>&mdash;Early this morning a false alarm was
brought in from the Cawnpore road, that the enemy
was upon us. Captain Evans, who had been sent
out to gain information, returned with the above
report, which created for a short period some needless
alarm. We continued hard at work getting in
supplies and adding to our defences. Many vague
reports of disturbances were in circulation to-day.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 12th.</i>&mdash;On this day an instance of disaffection
from within the camp occurred. The regiment
of military police, commanded by Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
Orr, mutinied in a body, rushed to their lines, seized
their arms, and then set off in the direction of
Cawnpore, giving themselves no time to inflict any
damage in their quarter of the city. So great was
their haste, that they failed to empty their own barracks,
and left behind them their clothes and baggage.
Information of this was given to headquarters;
on which two guns of Major Kaye's battery,
two companies of Her Majesty's 32nd, and
some seventy Seikhs of the 1st Oude Irregular
Cavalry, the whole under the command of Colonel
Inglis, were despatched after them. They were
pursued for some eight miles before they were come
up with, and it was only by pushing on the cavalry
and guns, without waiting for the slower movements
of the infantry, that they were overtaken at all.</p>

<p>The guns opened fire as soon as practicable; they
had come up well over some difficult ground, but
their horses were, in consequence, so done up, that
there was some difficulty in taking up the most
desirable position. Once the cavalry charged well,
but neither the result of their charge, nor of the
practice of the artillery, was such as might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
been expected. The enemy's loss was not exactly
ascertained, but it was supposed that they had some
twenty killed, and ten prisoners were brought in.
Of Captain Forbes's men, two Pathans were killed
on the spot; and some others, including a gallant old
native officer, wounded. Mr. Thornhill, of the civil
service, charging with them, was also wounded.
All this time the infantry were far behind, unable
to get up. A village lay to the front, in which
many of the insurgents had taken refuge. Colonel
Inglis forbade its bombardment, as it would have
entailed much injury to innocent villagers; and the
evening was, by that time, so far advanced, that the
measure would probably not have sufficed to dislodge
the mutineers.</p>

<p>About an hour remained to sunset; the guns and
cavalry were a long way from the infantry, and
many miles further from home. A return movement
was therefore ordered, and accomplished successfully:
the whole force returned about 8 o'clock,
having gone over some sixteen or eighteen miles of
ground.</p>

<p>The Europeans had marched well to the front.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
It was a hard day's work for them, and two men
were lost from apoplexy, for the heat was dreadful.</p>

<p>On this day the horses of the men of the 7th
Cavalry were brought down and picketed close to
the Baillie Guard; as, with a very few exceptions,
the 13th, 48th, and 71st Regiments of Native Infantry
and 7th Cavalry had been ordered to proceed
on leave till October, and their arms and accoutrements
were brought down and deposited in the
Residency. (Vide No. 1 in the Appendix.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 13th.</i>&mdash;Shot and shell both brought down to
the garrison from Muchee Bhawun (about three-quarters
of a mile). Unabated exertions to add to
the defences of the garrison.</p>

<p>The 13th Regiment of Native Infantry, 170 rank
and file, came down from cantonments and encamped
in the Residency compound. Ineffectual efforts to
blow down the <i>Furrahd Buksh</i> Gateway. Three or
four cases of cholera occurred at Fort Muchee
Bhawun. Officers' servants began to desert. Intelligence
was received from Fyzabad of the mutiny
of all the troops there. Heat beyond endurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Garrison in good spirits, and much elated at the
brush after the Police Corps. Little reliance was
placed in natives, and every possible precaution was
taken to prevent any treachery. The native gunners,
both in the Residency and at the Muchee Bhawun,
were so posted as to be under the immediate fire of
the Europeans, who watched them carefully both
day and night. An officer was on duty at the gate
all day long, to observe all incomers, and to prevent
arms being brought in by others than those who
had received passes.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 14th.</i>&mdash;Supplies of shot and shell brought
in from Muchee Bhawun. Every exertion made
to increase the defences of the garrisons. No reliable
intelligence was procurable of the state of
affairs at Cawnpore. Many idle rumours afloat,
but not corroborated, with regard to a reinforcement
of Europeans having arrived at that station
from the north-west. Heat excessive. Several
cases of cholera and smallpox. A few cases of the
former disease proved fatal in Muchee Bhawun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
Hardinge's corps still steady. About 200 of the
Oude Irregular Cavalry deserted last night.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 15th.</i>&mdash;A hundred barrels of gunpowder
brought from the Muchee Bhawun, and buried in
the Residency enclosure. Shot and shell continued
to be brought into garrison from Muchee Bhawun.
Uncovenanted servants were drilled with muskets.
A tragic event occurred this day:&mdash;Serjeant-major
K., 7th Light Cavalry, shot with a pistol,
Riding-master Edridge, 7th Light Cavalry, in
the heat of an argument. The riding-master died
a few hours after. No reliable intelligence was
procured from Cawnpore, though vague reports
were in circulation. The death of Lieutenant-Colonel
Fisher, commanding 15th Irregular Cavalry,
by the hands of his own men, was reported.</p>

<p>Captain Gall's servant returned to the garrison
this day, reporting his master's death, which took
place by stratagem, and by the hands of his own
men. Captain Gall was proceeding in disguise <i>en route</i>
to Allahabad, with twelve sowars of his own corps,
and had proceeded about fifty miles on his way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
when his murder took place. All officers of the
cantonments were ordered down to the garrison,
with the exception of the commanding officers and
regimental staff. Twenty-three lacs of rupees
were buried close in front of the Residency, for
security, and to avoid the necessity of guards and
sentries over it. Rum and porter (one-half) was
received into the Residency from Muchee Bhawun.
Fever was prevalent. The Seikhs of the 13th
Native Infantry, numbering about fifty men, were
formed, at their own request, into a company,
under the command of Captain Germon, and sent
to Muchee Bhawun. Spare clothing of the 13th
was brought in from cantonments. Continued
efforts were made to blow up the Furrah Buksh
Gate. The flooring of the first story fell in this day.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 16th.</i>&mdash;A quantity of shot and shells came in
from Muchee Bhawun; also an 18-pounder gun. The
shot was piled, as far as possible. On this date, there
were seven 18-pounders in position. The whole day
was expended in working hard at a battery in a position
commanding the Cawnpore-road, and in unroofing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
houses, burying powder, &amp;c. The gate leading into
the Furrah Buksh came down in the course of
the forenoon with a great crash, after many futile
attempts had been made for its destruction. This
was an important point gained, as the Residency compound
was quite commanded from the top of this
gate.</p>

<p>This morning, twenty-two conspirators, emissaries
from Benares and elsewhere, who had been
sent to corrupt the troops at this place, were captured
in a house in the centre of the city. Information
having been given to Captain Hughes, commanding
the 4th Irregular Infantry, he directed two staunch
native officers to put themselves on the watch, and
to pretend participation in the disaffection. This
they did, and by this means, with Captain Carnegie's
assistance, Captain Hughes was enabled to effect the
capture of these inciters to mutiny. They were
forthwith brought to a drum-head court-martial
and the whole of them condemned to death.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 17th.</i>&mdash;This morning, four of the men sentenced
yesterday, were hanged at the Muchee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
Bhawun; the remaining eighteen were liberated,
as some doubts were entertained of their guilt.</p>

<p>Vague and most contradictory rumours came in
this day about Cawnpore, but no authentic intelligence
could be gained. The intelligence department,
under the supervision of Mr. Gubbins, with two assistants,
seemed to experience great difficulty in procuring
reliable intelligence. Amongst others, Colonel
Palmer, commanding the 48th Regiment Native Infantry,
came in from the cantonments, waited on the
Brigadier-General, and reported large assemblies
of men near cantonments, the immediate abandonment
of which he most earnestly advocated.</p>

<p>Although there yet remained some twenty-five lacs
in the treasury, the expenditure had been on such an
enormous scale during the last week, that cash payments
were suspended, unless in exceptional cases.
The money rewards, &amp;c., promised to men of the
several infantry regiments, whose good behaviour
had been conspicuous on the night of the mutiny,
were discharged by promissory notes. Major Apthorp
of the 41st Native Infantry had an advance
made to him to pay up and discharge twenty-five of his
men who had escorted in the officers and ladies from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
Seetapore; as it was reported by one of his drummers,
that even these faithful few, who had all been
promised promotion by Sir Henry Lawrence for
their fidelity on that occasion, had expressed themselves
to the effect that if Rajah Maun Singh came
against them, they would all have to go over, and
would murder their officers.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;The force at the Residency, consisting
of the regular troops, civilians, volunteers of all
sorts, and, in fact, every man within the defences
not incapacitated by sickness, were ordered by Sir
Henry Lawrence to parade at sunrise. Every man
was to be at the post he was to occupy in case of an
attack; and those to whom no posts had been assigned
mustered in front of the Residency, for the
purpose of having a post or duty assigned them.
The Brigadier-General inspected the whole of them,
and visited all the outposts and picquets.</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day the force was
paraded a second time, and minutely inspected by
Colonel Inglis. A body of fifty volunteers, belonging
to the several offices, had been trained and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
drilled to use firearms. To them was entrusted the
defence of two outposts near the Post-office, which
place had been made a very strong position. The
officers comprising the volunteer corps of cavalry
were also given arms, to be able to make a stand
and defend themselves within their own quarters.
They furnished sentries at night, and exercised a
supervision over some seventy Seikh sowars, the
remains of the Oude Irregular Cavalry. These, as
well as the body of clerks, &amp;c., mentioned above,
were in all respects armed and accoutred like private
soldiers. Besides this, many of the volunteers and
officers were instructed in gun drill; and, at the
Muchee Bhawun, by Sir Henry's directions, some
fifty or sixty of the 32nd Foot were told off for the
same work. A very strong battery (the Redan) was
commenced this day; it completely commanded the
iron bridge and the road leading to cantonments.</p>

<p>The servants of Captains Staples, 7th Cavalry,
and Burmester, 48th Native Infantry, returned
and reported the murder of those officers whose
heads, they stated, were carried to the Nana at
Cawnpore; and that Lieutenant Boulton, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
7th-Cavalry, jumped his horse into the river, and
nothing further had been heard of him. Owing to
the want of rain, the heat had now become intense.
Cholera and dysentery were on the increase; chiefly
at the Muchee Bhawun.</p>

<p>Reports came in of some bodies of the enemy being
at a place called Nawab Gunge, about eighteen
miles from Lucknow, and Captain Forbes, with
twenty Sikhs and ten of the volunteer cavalry corps,
was sent out there to ascertain the presence or
otherwise of the enemy. They returned in the
evening bringing information that there was no one.
The company of the 10th Oude Irregular Force was
brought down from the Dâk Bungalow to the jail.
This regiment was the last to give way at Seetapore,
and it was reported they did not molest their officers.</p>

<p>Quantities of bhoosa were collected and stored
within the Racket Court, which was now half full.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;This morning Sir Henry Lawrence
inspected the Muchee Bhawun minutely. More
small arm ammunition was brought in from thence
to the Residency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
A fresh case of smallpox occurred today (Mr.
Bird, who was immediately removed to a tent in the
compound). The uncovenanted volunteers were
again minutely inspected this afternoon. The
engineer officers were very hard at work completing
the batteries and defences. Upwards of 3000
coolies were at work unroofing houses in the vicinity
of our defences.</p>

<p>From cantonments all the spare baggage, &amp;c. was
brought in, and every preparation made to prevent
confusion in case the position there should be
abandoned. In the city of Lucknow everything
remained perfectly quiet,&mdash;the administration of
justice was in no way impeded. Grain was stored
in large quantities in the church.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;This day, "the Redan" was completed.
It consisted of one 18-pounder gun and one
9-pounder, with two mortars in their rear&mdash;the
whole commanding the iron bridge and open country
across the river. The Cawnpore 18-pounder
battery was very nearly finished, and an expense
magazine establishment near it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
A letter bearing date the 18th instant was received
from Cawnpore, written by Captain Moore
of Her Majesty's 32nd Foot, by direction of General
Wheeler,&mdash;it informed us, at last, of occurrences
at that place. All the numerous previous
reports regarding the reinforcements of European
troops said to have been received, were thereby
falsified. No such reinforcements had ever been
received. The letter informed us of their ability
to hold out for some fifteen days more. The dreadful
news of a boat load of European ladies, women,
and children, from Futteghurh, having been intercepted
at Cawnpore and assassinated there, was
confirmed by natives.</p>

<p>Supplies continued to be stored, but they were
collected with difficulty and at increased prices.</p>

<p>Large stacks of firewood, which had been stored
in case of difficulties, were regularly arranged in a
semicircle, protecting the front of the Residency, and
covered with earth; these formed an embankment
six feet in height, and embrasures were cut through
them for the guns, of which there were four 9-pounders
on that side.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></div>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 21st.</i>&mdash;Two hundred guns, many of large
calibre, were found in the gardens of the Seish
Mahul, behind the Dowlut Khana (a large building
on the north side of the city). There were no
carriages to them. This startling discovery was
luckily made in time. Twenty-seven guns were at
once brought in, and arrangements made for parking
the remainder.</p>

<p>In the evening, as the church was full of grain,
divine service was performed in Mr. Gubbins's
garden; and, during the night, Sir Henry himself
once more visited the outposts, which had, by this
time, been brought to a satisfactory state. The
guards of the uncovenanted service were well on
the alert, and prepared for any emergency. The
difficulty of procuring all kinds of grain daily increased.
Many rumours of a strong force marching
on Lucknow from Fyzabad. The force in cantonments
held in readiness to march at one hour's
notice, to the Residency and the Muchee Bhawun.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 22nd.</i>&mdash;This morning Captain Radcliffe's
troop of volunteer cavalry were despatched, at 1 <small>A.M.</small>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
towards Nawab Gunge, to patrol the roads in that
direction, in conjunction with the Seikhs, in order to
gather information. About 4 o'clock <small>A.M.</small> a thunderstorm
from the east, with the much wished for rain,
came on. It lasted no very long time, and afforded
only a temporary relief from the excessive heat.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence made an excursion as far
as the Husainabad Kolwallee, garrisoned by nearly
3000 police and others, and inspected them and
the defences of that place. He also visited the
Dowlut Khana, an old magazine, and on his return
went over the Muchee Bhawun defences. All our
available spare carts, hackeries, and wagons, were
to-day employed in bringing in the guns found
yesterday. Many of them were of large size. The
unroofing and clearing away of houses continued
without intermission, and every exertion was made
to remove anything which might afford cover in the
immediate vicinity of our defences.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 23rd.</i>&mdash;Two men executed this morning
at the Muchee Bhawun,&mdash;the one a mutineer
(a naick of the 71st Native Infantry), the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
a man who had, on the night of the mutiny,
threatened the life of Mr. Yarbury, a merchant.</p>

<p>A large battery traced out, looking to the westward.
It was to consist of at least two heavy guns,
and to be raised so as to bombard the town in that
direction. A considerable amount of labour would
have been required to raise it to the necessary
elevation. Altogether it was the most extensive
work of the kind we had yet undertaken. An
8-inch howitzer, which had been discovered with
the other guns at the Seesh Muhal, was mounted
and placed in the Redan battery.</p>

<p>Captain Radcliffe's troop of volunteers, numbering
forty sabres, were drilled and exercised daily; and
now that the majority of the Irregular Cavalry had
deserted, and the remainder were not considered
trustworthy, the troops supplied two mounted orderlies
every morning to escort Sir Henry Lawrence
into the city.</p>

<p>The commanding officer of the 71st Regiment
Native Infantry reported the remnant of the Seikhs
of his regiment (about twenty men, who had remained
true on the night of the <i>émeute</i>) as being in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
insubordinate state, and no longer to be trusted.
Sir Henry Lawrence desired them to be sent to
him, and spoke to them. They had asked for their
discharge before, and had very precipitately been
disarmed by their commanding officer, without sufficient
authority. After being spoken to by the
Brigadier-General, they professed themselves quite
willing to continue their services: they were taken
at their word, their arms restored, and were kept at
the Residency under the command of an officer.</p>

<p>A letter was received yesterday from Cawnpore,
written under the direction of General Sir H. M.
Wheeler, K.C.B., giving very bad news indeed. It
stated that the enemy shelled them for the last eight
days, which had had fearful effect within their crowded
trenches, and one third of their number had been killed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Muchee Bhawun garrison
had not been idle at their defences, and Sir Henry
was constant in his visits there, as well as to the
Seesh Muhal, and Dowlut Khana. On the westward
side of the Muchee Bhawun, a heavy tower
was commenced; a work of great labour, from which
a flanking fire could be given. In the vicinity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
the fort, as at the Residency, houses were unroofed,
and walls pulled down, so as to leave as little shelter
as we could. Magazines were constructed, and the
powder placed in safety.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 24th.</i>&mdash;Heavy clouds, and every appearance
of rain throughout the day, but none fell. Heat
excessive. Sir Henry Lawrence proceeded at daybreak
as usual, attended by his staff and two orderlies
from the volunteer cavalry, and inspected the
Dowlut Khana, Seesh Muhal, Imaumbarah Kolwallee,
and Muchee Bhawun; and in the evening he
proceeded five miles on the Fyzabad road, to ascertain
if there was a good position we could take up,
in case of an advance of the rebels in that direction.</p>

<p>The last of the guns discovered in the Seesh
Muhal garden were brought in to-day. Four of
them were of very large calibre&mdash;two being
32-pounders. <i>Native</i> reports describe the force at
Cawnpore as being hard pressed. Native reports
from Allahabad were good. Much progress made
in knocking down and unroofing the houses in the
<i>immediate</i> vicinity of the Muchee Bhawun and Residency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
The Racket Court was now filled with
bhoosa for the cattle, and thatched in. We were
supposed to have nearly three months' supply of
provisions now stored. The mutineers were reported
to have arrived at Nawabgunge (eighteen
miles distant), and were said to have with them
some sixteen guns.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 25th.</i>&mdash;The tower at the Muchee Bhawun
was carried on this day with great ardour. Crowds
of coolies were employed under the direction of Lieutenant
Innes of the Engineers. This defence was to
command the stone bridge, the Imaumbara, and a
number of high mosques facing that side of the Muchee
Bhawun. Elephants were yoked to one of the
heaviest guns,&mdash;luckily there was some gear for the
purpose, and the experiment turned out successful.</p>

<p>A native rumour reported the arrival of a strong
force of mutineers at Nawabgunge, where it was
said they were to remain till they had consolidated
their force. Good news came in to-day from Allahabad
in a letter from the officer commanding
the 1st Madras Fusileers, dated the 18th of June, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
answer to one despatched from this place on the 15th
instant. Colonel Neil's letter gave little or no detail,
beyond stating that he assumed command of the
fort on the 11th instant; that there had been much
fighting, but all the mutineers were entirely broke
and dispersed, and the cantonments reoccupied.
Cholera broke out on the 18th among the Fusileers,
who in two days had had amongst them 100 cases,
forty of which had proved fatal. Every effort was
being made to push on troops to Cawnpore, but the
road was not open, and carriage was difficult to
procure: also that Her Majesty's 84th were close
at hand, and that the telegraphic communication
had been re-established between Calcutta and Allahabad.
No authentic intelligence from Cawnpore,
and much anxiety was felt regarding the force there.</p>

<p>All appearance of rain had gone off, and the heat
was almost insupportable. The river had risen
about a foot and a half, and was no longer fordable.
A letter was received from Mrs. Dorin, stating that
she was residing in a hut close to Seetapore, soliciting
money and assistance, and reporting the murder
of her husband. Numbers of gun-barrels and locks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
were brought in from the old magazine, where a
great quantity of crowsfeet were found, and ordered
to be brought in to-morrow. Behind Mr. Ommanney's
house, a very large battery was commenced
by Lieutenant Hutchinson. Quantities of
grass and stores were brought in.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;This morning Sir Henry Lawrence,
accompanied by his staff, as usual inspected the
principal buildings in the vicinity of the Muchee
Bhauwn and the new round tower, at which great
progress had been made, and in which not less
than 300 coolies were at work. Proceeding thence
he inspected the newly completed defences opposite
the Kolwallee. On his return, Sir H. Lawrence
received a letter from Major Raikes at
Mynpoorie, giving intelligence of the capture of
the city of Delhi on the 13th instant (this afterwards
turned out to be a false report). A royal
salute was ordered to be fired from the Residency,
Muchee Bhawun, and cantonments, and a <i>feu-de-joie</i>
was fired by the Irregulars, who were quartered
in the Dowlut Khana, under the command of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Brigadier Gray. Many useful stores, consisting of
unwrought materials, rope, and platforms, were
brought in from the old magazine. Considerable
progress was made in a new battery for heavy guns,
which had been commenced in the rear of Mr.
Ommanney's house.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a letter, dated June 23rd,
was received from Colonel Neil, commanding at
Allahabad, reporting all well there; that 750
Europeans had arrived, and that 1000 more would
be with him on the next day; that every effort
was being made to despatch 400 Europeans, two
guns, and 300 Seikhs to Cawnpore, but that much
difficulty was experienced in procuring carriage.</p>

<p>Also, at sunset, a letter was received from Sir
H. M. Wheeler, K.C.B., dated the 24th instant,
detailing his losses, and giving an account of the
outbreak, and stating that he had supplies for only
eight or ten days at the farthest. His letter
was replied to at once, and he was informed by
Sir Henry Lawrence of the news received from
Allahabad, and also that in ten days at the farthest
he would receive aid from Allahabad, and that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
must husband his resources as much as possible;
that the force at Lucknow was threatened by an
attack from eight or ten regiments, three or four of
which were within twenty miles.</p>

<p>A reward of one lac of rupees was offered this day
for the capture, within a week, dead or alive, of the
Nana, at Cawnpore, and means were taken to have
the proclamation widely disseminated. With the
larger battery commenced to the south, behind Mr.
Ommanney's house, we had three large batteries in
progress, and were also busily employed in destroying,
as far as possible, any buildings that might give
cover in the vicinity. Five or six elephants were
in course of training to drag heavy guns, so as to
enable us to move out without delay, should circumstances
require a heavy gun to be taken out.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>27th June.</i>&mdash;This morning a letter from Lieutenant
Burnes, Adjutant of the 10th Regiment
Oude Irregular Infantry, late at Seetapore, was
received. It gave an account of the mutiny at that
place, and of the escape of himself, Sir M. Jackson,
Bart., and sisters (one of whom had been carried off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
for some days by the sepoys and brought back), and
some others, to a place called Mitowlee, where
they claimed and received the protection (charily
given) of a rajah: they were then all in the
jungles, suffering the <i>greatest</i> hardships. It also
mentioned the safety of another party with Captain
Hearsey; who, however, were also in the jungles.
Many of these seem to have had the most hairbreadth
escapes. No rain had yet fallen, and the
heat was most oppressive. The cholera had abated
during the past few days, but several cases of smallpox
had, however, occurred. The river was reported
to have fallen a foot since yesterday.</p>

<p>A report was in circulation early in the day,
that General Wheeler had made terms with "the
Nana," at Cawnpore; but few believed it, and in
the evening it was reported incorrect, as heavy
firing had been heard yesterday at Cawnpore from
Bunnee. Three boxes of crow's feet and a great
number of musket-barrels and unwrought stores
were brought in from the old magazine at the
Dowlut-Khana; also a very large quantity of gun
carriage-wheels. The force at Nawabgunge was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
said to be increasing, but very undecided as to
what to do. A great force of coolies were at work,
and much progress was made in the defences at
Muchee Bhawun and the Residency.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>28th June.</i>&mdash;This morning, at about 3 <small>A.M.</small>, we
had a heavy fall of rain, which continued with
slight intervals till 7 <small>A.M.</small> Sir Henry Lawrence
proceeded to Hosainabad and examined the defensive
preparations made there; returning by the Muchee
Bhawun, he found that the buildings occupied
by the 32nd had hardly leaked at all. Divine
service was performed in the City Hospital (brigade
mess), occupied by the officers of the 7th
Cavalry, 13th, 48th, and 71st Native Infantry, at
7 <small>A.M.</small> Spies stated that the 17th Regiment Native
Infantry, numbering between 250 and 300 men, had
gone with five lacs of rupees to Onao on the Cawnpore
road&mdash;it was believed with the intention of
proceeding to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>It having been reported that there were many
jewels and valuables in the king's palace, which
might fall into the hands of the mutineers, a party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
under Major Banks, consisting of fifty of the 13th,
twenty Seikhs 71st Native Infantry, and the European
Volunteer Cavalry, were sent out to fetch
them in; which they did about 6 <small>P.M.</small>, and reported
that they had discovered a large gun.</p>

<p>About 7 <small>P.M.</small> three different natives brought in
the very sad and distressing news that the Cawnpore
force, having no more ammunition left, had entered
into a treaty with their enemies, after which they had
all been treacherously murdered, as they embarked
in boats to proceed down the river to Allahabad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorin, wife of Lieutenant Dorin, who lately
commanded the 10th Regiment Oude Irregular
Forces, arrived this evening in a country cart, disguised
as a native, and accompanied by some
clerks. She was for very many days secreted in a
village close to Seetapore, and her escape is wonderful.
The Serjeant-Major's wife of the 9th Regiment
Oude Irregular Infantry also arrived in a
doolie, severely wounded. From 8 to 10 o'clock
<small>P.M.</small> it rained heavily. A letter, dated the 21st
June, received from Benares from Mr. Gubbins,
giving an account of the number of Europeans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
coming up the country, and describing the state
of Benares and Allahabad; reporting also an action
at Delhi on the 8th instant, when the British troops
captured twenty-six guns. News also received from
Agra by letter from Captain Nixon, political agent.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;This morning, a brass gun, a 21-pounder
which had been accidentally discovered
yesterday by the party who had been despatched
under Major Banks, to bring in valuables from the
palace (called the "Kiser Bagh,") was brought in,
carriage and waggon all completely ready for immediate
service. Some grape shot and powder,
chiefly damaged, was also discovered in an adjacent
house.</p>

<p>The people in charge of the palace, without
giving a thought to resistance as it was at first
expected they might do, nevertheless showed an
evident reluctance to give information where the
arms, &amp;c. were stored. However, it came out at
last, that there were more arms within the palace,
and a party was despatched to secure them. Seven
cart-loads were brought in; chiefly flint muskets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
with a few spears, &amp;c.: 4 small guns were also discovered
and brought in.</p>

<p>A small party of volunteers, cavalry (twelve men
including officers), were sent along the Cawnpore road
to bring in information. After going some twelve
miles, they returned, having learnt that there were
some two or three regiments not far off them. Captain
Forbes, with the Seikh Cavalry, was sent off at
sunrise to patrol the Nawabgunge road. Six men
were also sent on the Sultanpore road to gain information.
Both the parties returned at sunset,
Captain Forbes bringing intelligence that the enemy
were at Chinât, nine miles off.</p>

<p>Our defences progressed, but labour was not so
easy to procure as it had been some days before.</p>

<p class="center gap-between">*****</p>

<p>The enemy being in strength so near, it was
deemed advisable to withdraw the troops from cantonments,
which was quietly done at sunset; and it
being expected that the enemy would march on
Lucknow, Sir Henry Lawrence thought it advisable
to move out with a strong force, hoping to
meet and oppose them before they entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
suburbs of the city. In order to prevent any notice
reaching the enemy of the intended movement, the
orders were not given out publicly till 3 o'clock on
the following morning, and at the same hour twenty
Seikhs under Lieutenant Birch were to be sent to
the Iron Bridge, in order to prevent any one
crossing over with intelligence of the movement to
the enemy.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>June 30th.</i>&mdash;Pursuant to orders, a force, comprising
150 of the 32nd from the Muchee Bhawun, 130
of the 13th Native Infantry, forty Seikhs of the 13th
Native Infantry, the 48th, numbering fifty bayonets,
the European cavalry thirty-six strong, the Oude
Irregular Cavalry, about ninety men, four of the
guns of Kaye's battery (Europeans), two of
Alexander's guns (natives), two of Bryce's guns
(natives), and an eight-inch howitzer, found in the
town a few days ago, and which was drawn by two
elephants, assembled at the iron bridge at 5·45
<small>A.M.</small> The advance guard was composed of twenty-five
Seikh Cavalry, and fifteen European Cavalry;
twenty Seikh Infantry, and twenty of the 32nd Regiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
the whole under the command of Captain
Stevens of the 32nd Foot.</p>

<p>The eight-inch howitzer, two guns of Alexander's
battery, two of Kaye's battery, the 13th Native Infantry,
two of Bryce's guns, and the detachment of
the 32nd Foot, formed the main body, and marched
in the above order. The rear guard was composed
of the 48th Native Infantry, under Colonel Palmer;
the whole force being under the personal command
of Sir Henry Lawrence. It was the Brigadier-General's
original intention only to proceed to the end
of the Pucka road, to the village of Kocaralee; and
on their arrival there, our force was halted, and the
Brigadier-General, with the advanced guard, proceeded
about a mile to the front, whence no one was
to be seen. The force was on the point of being
ordered to return, when it was decided to make a
further reconnaissance; and soon after the enemy
were fallen in with, in overwhelming numbers, and
the force was compelled to retire with the loss of
the eight-inch howitzer, and three 9-pounders.</p>

<p>The enemy came boldly on, and invested us on
all sides, firing from all the houses round, which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
rapidly loopholed; they also erected a hasty battery
for the eight-inch howitzer across the river, from
which they threw several well-directed shells; and
they began to collect boats for a bridge across the
river, the iron bridge being under fire from the
Redan.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 1st.</i>&mdash;The enemy threw in a very heavy
fire of musketry all day and night. Early in the
morning they advanced to attack, but were repulsed
on all sides with considerable loss from our shells,
guns, and musketry. Mr. McRae, of the Civil
Engineers Department, and Lieutenant Dashwood,
48th Native Infantry, were wounded, while assisting
in working an 18-pounder in the Post Office
Battery.</p>

<p>During the day attempts were made to get messengers
to cross over to the Muchee Bhawun fort;
two or three men started, but as their success was
very doubtful, it was determined to work the telegraph
on the top of the Residency. This had been
previously arranged by the engineer in concert with
one on the Muchee Bhawun; it simply consisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
of one post with a bar at the top, from which were
suspended in one row black stuffed bags, each
having its own pulley to work it. After having attracted
the attention of the Muchee Bhawun Garrison,
the greatest difficulty was found in working
the telegraph, from various causes; the chief of
which was the tremendous fire which the enemy
opened on the spot directly they saw our people on
the flat open roof of the Residency. It rained rifle
balls, principally from the top of the jail, and some
few of the ropes of the bags were actually cut by
them; then the pulleys went wrong, and twice the
whole machine had to be taken down, and after readjustment
put up again. After three hours' hard
work under a broiling sun and a heavy fire, the
transfer of messages was at last completed.</p>

<p>The message was simply an order to blow up the
place and come to the Residency at 12 <small>P.M.</small>, bringing
the treasure and guns, and destroying as much as possible
all spare ammunition. The night was anxiously
looked for, as the retreat of the retiring force might
be intercepted, and the enemy had the advantage of
position. To help the movement, the Brigadier-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
gave orders that shortly before 12 <small>P.M.</small>, the
different mortars and guns from our batteries should
open fire, in order to distract the attention of the
enemy. This was carried out; especially towards
the iron bridge, by which the force must pass.</p>

<p>The movement was most successfully performed;
and so quick and noiseless was the march, that at
12·15 the head of the column was at the Lower Water
Gate. Here there was some little delay, as the force
not being so quickly expected, the gates had not been
opened. A very serious accident had nearly happened
in consequence of this, for the leading men,
finding the gates closed, shouted out "Open the
gates," and the artillerymen at the guns above,
which, loaded with grape, covered the entrance, mistook
the words for "Open with grape," and were
already at the guns, when an officer put them right.
The whole force came in without a shot being
fired.</p>

<p>The explosion had not yet taken place; but soon,
a shake of the earth, a volume of fire, a terrific report,
and an immense mass of black smoke shooting
far up into the air, announced to Lucknow, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
240 barrels of gunpowder, and 594,000 rounds of
ball and gun ammunition, had completed the destruction
of Muchee Bhawun, which we had with
so much labour provisioned and fortified.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 2nd.</i>&mdash;Arrangements were made for posting
and stationing the Muchee Bhawun force which
came in last night, and placing the field-pieces in
position; all of which Sir H. Lawrence himself
personally superintended. About 8 <small>A.M.</small> Sir Henry
returned to the Residency, and, being much fatigued,
laid down on his bed. Soon after an eight-inch shell
from the eight-inch howitzer of the enemy, entered
the room at the window, and exploding, a fragment
struck the Brigadier-General on the upper part of the
right thigh near the hip, inflicting a fearful wound.
Captain Wilson, who was standing alongside the bed
with one knee on it at the time, reading a memorandum
to Sir Henry, was knocked down by falling
bricks and slightly wounded in the back by a piece
of shell. Sir H. Lawrence's nephew, Mr. Lawrence,
had an equally narrow escape, being on another bed
close by: he was not hurt; the fourth individual in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the room was a native servant, who lost one of his
feet by a fragment of the shell. It was at once pronounced
that Sir Henry Lawrence's wound was
mortal, and his sufferings were great. He immediately
sent for Major Banks, and appointed him to
succeed him as Chief-Commissioner, and appointed
Colonel Inglis to command the troops. He was then
removed to Dr. Fayrer's house, which was somewhat
less under fire. About noon this day, a round shot
came into a room on the lower story of the residency,
and shattered the thigh of Miss Palmer (daughter of
Colonel Palmer, 48th Regiment, Native Infantry)
so dreadfully, that instant amputation was obliged to
be resorted to. All the garrison were greatly grieved,
and the Natives much dispirited at our severe loss,
in that popular and very distinguished officer, Sir
Henry Lawrence.</p>

<p>A perfect hurricane of jinjal, round shot, and
musketry all day and all night. Probably not less
than 10,000 men fired into our position from the
surrounding houses; the balls fell in showers, and
hardly any place was safe from them. Many of
the garrison were hit in places which, before the
siege, it was considered would be perfectly safe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
but the enemy fired some of them from a great distance
out of the town, from the tops of high houses,
and the balls fell everywhere.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 3rd.</i>&mdash;It is difficult to chronicle the proceedings
of these few days, for everywhere confusion
reigned supreme. That unfortunate day of Chinât
precipitated everything, inasmuch as we were closely
shut up several days before anything of the kind was
anticipated. People had made no arrangements for
provisioning themselves: many indeed never dreamt
of such a necessity; and the few that had were
generally too late. Again, many servants were shut
out the first day, and all attempts to approach us
were met by a never-ceasing fusilade. But though
they could not get in, they succeeded in getting out;
and after a few days, those who could boast of servants
or attendants of any kind formed a very small and
envied minority. The servants in many instances
eased their masters of any superfluous article of
value, easy of carriage. In fact, the confusion can
be better imagined than described.</p>

<p>The head of the Commissariat had, most unfortunately
for the garrison, received a severe wound at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
Chinât, which effectually deprived them of his valuable
aid. His office was all broken up; his goomastahs
and baboos were not with us, and the officers appointed
to assist him were all new hands. Besides all this,
the first stores opened were approachable only by
one of the most exposed roads, and very many of
the camp followers preferred going without food to
the chance of being shot. Some did not know
where to apply, so that for three or four days, many
went without rations; and this in no small degree
added to the number of desertions. Owing to these
desertions, the commissariat and battery bullocks
had no attendants to look after them, and went
wandering all over the place looking for food; they
tumbled into, wells, were shot down in numbers by
the enemy, and added greatly to the labour which
fell on the garrison, as fatigue parties of civilians and
officers, after being in the defences all day repelling
the enemy's attack, were often employed six and
seven hours burying cattle killed during the day, and
which from the excessive heat became offensive in a
few hours. The artillery and other horses were
everywhere to be seen loose, fighting and tearing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
one another, driven mad for want of food and water;
the garrison being too busily employed in the trenches
to be able to secure them.</p>

<p>Poor Sir H. Lawrence suffered somewhat less to-day,
but was sinking fast, and at times his mind
wandered. A tremendous fire all day, more particularly
on the Baillie Guard and Dr. Fayrer's
house where Sir Henry was lying. We thus early
in the siege learnt that all our proceedings inside
were known (through some party or other) to our
enemies. Miss Palmer died to-day, and Mr. Ommanney
of the Civil Service, was dangerously
wounded under the ear by a grape shot, while in
the Redan battery.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 4th.</i>&mdash;A tremendous fire all night; but no
effort was made to storm our position. To the great
grief of our garrison, Sir Henry Lawrence died this
morning about 8 o'clock, from the effects of his
wound. Shortly before his death, Mr. G. H. Lawrence
while standing in the front verandah of Dr.
Fayrer's house, was wounded by a musket-ball
through his right shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
At night, there was a great uproar in the city,
which evidently underwent a thorough plundering.
Notwithstanding this, the same heavy fire was kept
up throughout the night. Every one at work trying
to throw up some shelter for himself. In the
course of the day, a 9-pounder, brought by the
insurgents and placed behind a small mosque close to
our furthest water-gate, was spiked by a private of
the 32nd and four others from Innes' post, who
shot four of the enemy. The enemy were taken by
surprise while at their dinner.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;From 2 till 6 o'clock <small>A.M.</small>, heavy
rain; and extremely heavy firing all day. Several
casualties among our garrison. A soldier of the
32nd was said to have killed five men in ten shots
from the Cawnpore battery, which was subjected
to a very severe musketry fire. Continued efforts
were made to collect all the horses and secure them,
but it was impossible to do anything during the day.
The fire was so heavy, and the night was so dark, it
was difficult to get hold of the animals, who were
half mad; added to which four or five horses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
killed daily, which had to be buried at night by
parties of officers, who, after being exposed to a
fearful sun in the trenches all day, were often out
in the rain till 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning,
engaged in burying horses and bullocks, in order to
prevent the dreadful stench which would otherwise
have been increased, and which had already become
almost insupportable.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;The usual amount of musketry and
cannon fire all the morning: about 2 o'clock in
the afternoon it became very severe, especially
towards the Baillie Guard, which seemed the favourite
point to-day for the heaviest fire. A heavy cannonade
heard about three miles off for about half an
hour. About 4 <i>P.M.</i> the flashes of the guns were
distinctly seen. The cause was unknown. The
enemy digging trenches in all directions. The carriage
of one of our 9-pounders was disabled by the
enemy.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 7th.</i>&mdash;A heavy fire all the morning.</p>

<p>A sortie was made by fifty of the 32nd and twenty
Sikhs, led by Captain Lawrence, Captain Mansfield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
Ensign Green, 13th Native Infantry, and Ensign
Studdy,&mdash;the latter led. The storming took place
at noon. The object was to examine M. Johannes'
house, and discover if the enemy were driving mines:
it was perfectly successful, and fifteen or twenty of
the enemy were killed. Our loss was one Seikh and
one 32nd slightly, and one 32nd severely wounded.</p>

<p>This afternoon a very sad event occurred. Major
Francis, 13th Native Infantry, who had commanded
at the Muchee Bhawun, and who was in command
of the brigade mess square, was struck in the legs by
a round shot, which completely fractured both legs,
rendering amputation of one <i>immediate</i>, and great
fears were entertained for the other. He was a
brave, good officer, and much respected by all, and
one in whom Sir Henry Lawrence had much confidence.
The calm manner in which he bore his
misfortune, gained him the sympathies of all. Not a
murmur escaped him; his only anxiety being a hope
that the authorities would bear testimony that he
had performed his duty. The Rev. Mr. Polehampton,
military chaplain, was severely wounded
in the side this day, by a rifle ball, while in hospital.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
One of the walls of the Racket Court, now used as
a bhoosa gadown, fell in, and a quantity of the bhoosa
became exposed in consequence. All spare tarpaulings
were immediately supplied to cover, it, and
officers and men worked hard for two hours, in a
deluge of rain. The rains, so long expected, seem
now fairly set in. It commenced raining heavily at
2 <small>P.M.</small>, and continued pouring down the whole
night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 8th.</i>&mdash;All very much as usual, and very
heavy rain fell, which somewhat abated the enemy's
fire. Every effort was made to put the place
in some kind of order and to feed the bullocks.</p>

<p>Poor Major Francis insensible and sinking: he
died at 7 <small>P.M.</small>; and was buried by a party of officers
close to Mr. Ommanney's grave. Every effort was
made to curtail the expenditure of provision, and
officers were placed on half rations every third day.
Very few servants remained, and most of the officers
had none. All were on duty thirteen and twenty
hours a day; and constant alarms took place at night,
rendering it necessary for all to stand to their arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Fears were entertained of the bhoosah stack taking
fire, as the outer wall of the Racket Court had fallen
down and left it exposed. All available officers and
men worked hard, in heavy rain, to get it covered in
again with tarpaulins. Twelve Seikhs of the 13th
Native Infantry deserted last night. All the Hindoos
and Mussulmans of the 13th, 48th, and 71st
behaved nobly.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 9th.</i>&mdash;Much rain fell during the morning.
About 4 <small>A.M.</small> the enemy made an attack on the
Baillie Guard Gate, and about 300 showed themselves,
shouting and sounding the "Advance," on the
bugle; but being received with a few rounds of grape,
and a steady fire from the 13th, they speedily disappeared.
Very much the same thing occurred soon after
at the Cawnpore battery. Continued firing all day.</p>

<p>This was now the tenth day of the siege, and the
heavy musketry fire on every side had never for an
instant ceased night or day; and at times the fire
was terrific. Many casualties occurred, and our
want of protection at the different crossings over
from one side of the Residency compound to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
other, was very much felt. To-day, an excellent
soldier, and a man greatly respected, Mr. Bryson,
formerly Serjeant-major of the 16th Lancers, was
shot through the head, while endeavouring to
strengthen his post. The enemy appeared to have
had some excellent marksmen. The commissariat
began to work well, and all were well supplied.
The officers were placed, however, on half rations
every third day as a precautionary measure.
Lieutenant Dashwood of the 48th Native Infantry,
died of cholera after a few hours' illness.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 10th.</i>&mdash;This morning the enemy's fire was
continued much as usual. A sepoy of the 13th was
killed early in the morning, and later in the day
a private of the 32nd Foot and an artilleryman
were wounded. The horses of the cavalry and the
artillery, which, during the first days of the siege,
were loose and driven nearly mad from hunger and
thirst, galloping about and creating the greatest
confusion, had now been nearly all turned out,
though not without much trouble; and fifty of the
best were retained, and secured in the Seikh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
square. All the bullocks were now also secured,
and arrangements made for feeding and watering
them; but numbers of horses and bullocks died, and
their burial at night by working parties, in addition
to nightly fatigue parties for the purpose of burying
the dead, carrying up supplies from exposed positions,
repairing entrenchments, draining, and altering
the position of guns, in addition to attending on the
wounded, caused excessive fatigue to the thin
garrison, who had but little rest night or day:
there were few officers with more than one servant,
and one third certainly had <i>none</i>. In all duties, the
officers equally shared the labours with the men,
carrying loads and digging pits for putrid animals,
at night, in heavy rain. All exerted themselves to
the utmost, alternately exposed to a burning sun
and heavy rain. Towards the middle of the day,
the enemy fired less than they had previously done
on any occasion since the siege commenced.</p>

<p>We received no news from any quarter, but sent
off many letters. Every exertion was made to grind
up the wheat in store by hand-mills; and this day
thirteen maunds and two seers were ground. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
firing towards the afternoon to-day was very slack,
comparatively speaking. There was a comparatively
slight cannonade. An injured 9-pounder in the
Cawnpore battery was removed by us and replaced
by another.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 11th.</i>&mdash;About 1 o'clock this morning the
whole force stood to their arms, in consequence of
some information which was received, reporting that
an attack was immediately intended. The force
remained prepared till daylight, when, as usual, a
smart firing on all sides began. An artilleryman
was killed at Captain Simmons's battery. The enemy
fired several round shot, and were most persevering
in keeping us on the alert, and worrying us as
much as possible. Their fire had never yet ceased
day or night: sometimes it was heavier than at
others, but it never abated altogether on any side.</p>

<p>At night the officers buried a horse which had
died close to the brigade square; the night was
intensely hot and close, and the labour was excessive:&mdash;the
horse having died on the Pucka
road, had to be dragged to a considerable distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
before a grave could be dug. A great many of
the stores were also brought up from the church by
the assistance of a fatigue party of officers, who had
all the carts to load and unload. Two of the 32nd
Foot were killed during the night, which passed off
with a heavy fire.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 12th.</i>&mdash;The heat still excessive, and the
fatigue of the garrison was <i>very</i> great. Enemy
were most persevering, and loopholed every place
within fifty or sixty yards of our defences. They
were evidently determined to do their best to get into
the position, and had closed in on every side. We
had no intelligence from any quarter; for though we
had sent out many messengers, not one returned.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock in the evening the enemy made
an attempt to attack the Baillie Gate; but fell back,
on being received with shells and musketry. About
12 <small>P.M.</small> they renewed their efforts on Mr. Gubbins's
side with similar effect. They repeatedly
sounded the advance, and were frequently heard
abusing each other for not advancing. In half
an hour they retired, and for the rest of the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
they contented themselves with a heavy fire on the
Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 13th.</i>&mdash;The heat was dreadful, and garrison
were greatly fatigued. The enemy reoccupied
Johannes's house, and fired smartly down the street,
killing two sepoys and wounding a conductor:
they also pushed close up under the Redan, and
greatly annoyed our outposts. Lieutenant Charlton
of the 32nd Foot was shot through the head
in the church, and very dangerously wounded.
Several shells were fired into Johannes's house, and
the walls of the house opposite to it were loopholed.
Nevertheless we could not dislodge them, and they
annoyed us greatly. The Havildar-major of the
13th was wounded through the thigh to-day.</p>

<p>The enemy possessed many excellent marksmen,
and fired so many shots from every point that it was
exceedingly dangerous to be seen anywhere, even
for an instant: they fired several logs of wood
bound with iron, and were evidently at this period
hard up for round shot. In the evening they fired
several carcases, and succeeded once in setting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Residency on fire; but it was soon extinguished.
All the European officers laboured hard to get the
supplies out of the church.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 14th.</i>&mdash;Heavy rain, thunder and lightning,
and night intensely dark. No alarms, and less firing
than usual. Heavy rain at daybreak, which cleared
off at 9 o'clock, when the enemy assembled in force.
They were apparently undecided how to act, for
they moved about in various directions, and in about
half an hour retired altogether; but they fired many
carcases, shot, and logs of wood shod with iron,
and displayed several new batteries. We threw up
a traverse near the Post-office gate, in order to save
our people from the fire from Johannes's house,
which was very sharp. Our sharp-shooters killed
four of the enemy in Johannes's house. Four Seikhs
of the 13th deserted, leaving their arms and accoutrements.
Still no information of any kind.</p>

<p>Enemy erecting new batteries; one of which
opened about 5 <small>P.M.</small> with a 9-pounder on the gable
end of the brigade mess, occupied by the ladies and
children, and the roof of which was held by a party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
of officers, assisted by six men of the 32nd. At the
first discharge, a soldier of the 32nd had his thigh
fractured, rendering amputation necessary. They
fired several iron shot, which tore away the parapet;
but fortunately no one else was hurt. The night
was very dark, and the enemy fired a great deal;
more particularly on Mr. Gubbins's post, where
Lieutenant Lester was mortally wounded: towards
daylight the fire abated. Several cases of
cholera. The enemy's fire to-day destroyed a
9-pounder of ours, smashing the axle tree all to
pieces.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;The enemy opened fire from their
9-pounder battery, situated about fifty yards from
the end of the brigade mess, and fired many shots;
but the garrison laid close, and up to 3 <small>P.M.</small> no
casualties occurred. Towards the middle of the
day, the enemy's fire lulled to a greater extent than
it had ever done since the siege commenced.</p>

<p>The stores out of Anderson's house got in; the
house being entirely destroyed by round shot;
though still nobly held by the garrison. A mortar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
moved down to the gate of the Post-office, behind
the traverse, and several shells were thrown into
Johannes's house. All much as usual. The enemy
fired three rounds of grape into the Redan battery
during the night, but fortunately hit no one.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 16th.</i>&mdash;The heat during the night was
fearful. A slight alarm about 2 <small>A.M.</small>, but it was
soon over. The enemy fired smartly throughout
the night, and in the morning sent several round
shot through the roof of the brigade mess, and hit
the Residency. They were busy, besides, making
batteries in the garden of Johannes's house, and
opposite the 13th and the Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p>We shelled the enemy heavily during the forenoon,
throwing them far into the town and across the
river. Lieutenant Bryce was badly wounded in the
thigh early this morning; and later in the day,
Lieutenant O'Brien of the 84th was shot through
the arm. In the evening the enemy kept up a
heavy fusilade, and we shelled them smartly; they
fired a shell which narrowly escaped falling into our
bhoosah stack. At half-past 11 o'clock, they fired a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
good deal on the Cawnpore battery, and made a feint
of attacking, but finding us well on the alert did not
do so. Our wheat-grinding operations continued,
and we now had hand-mills sufficiently well
worked to grind twenty maunds of atta daily.
During the night we threw up a stockade and traverse,
as a protection against the musketry which
swept the entrance of the Residency.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;The heat excessive. A very heavy
fire during the night, and the garrison kept on the
alert, preventing rest and greatly fatiguing all.
Several cases of cholera and deaths of children occurred.
Twenty-two maunds of wheat were ground.</p>

<p>To-day a bad accident occurred: Lieutenant Alexander,
of the Artillery, and Captain Barlow, 50th
Native Infantry, in firing a mortar, were most severely
burnt by the piece going off at the time of
loading. The enemy sent two shells into the Residency
which exploded, but fortunately caused no
loss of life. The stench from putrid animals was
most offensive. Painful boils about the head were
very prevalent. The wounded doing well. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
prisoners and main guard removed to another place,
in order to give more room at the hospital.</p>

<p>The enemy were busy making more batteries and
intrenchments. In the night about 12 o'clock, the
enemy made an attack on Mr. Gubbins's position, but
were received with a steady fire, and soon driven
back.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 18th.</i>&mdash;Rain began falling about 4 <small>A.M.</small> and
continued to do so till 8 <small>A.M.</small>, when the heat became
insufferable. The enemy fired several round shot,
which hit the brigade mess; and they also took up an
annoying position in one of the towers which remained
of the Ferad Buksh gate. They were,
however, speedily dislodged by a few exceedingly
well-directed shots from Lieutenant Bonham, from
an 18-pounder in the Post-office. Two children
died of cholera. In the evening the enemy fired
many round shot into the Post-office, Dr. Fayrer's,
Mr. Gubbins's and the brigade mess house: they
evidently had been reinforced in guns. At night,
Brigadier Inglis, Captain Wilson, Lieutenant Innes,
and Ensign Birch, proceeded to the gate with eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
Europeans, and dragged in a body that was seen
lying near the gate, and which it was supposed
might be the body of one of our spies shot coming
in. It was safely brought in, and found to be the
corpse of a woman. Nothing was found on the
body. The enemy got into the turret on the top of
Mr. Johannes' house, and fired into the Cawnpore
battery: fortunately no casualties occurred, and the
night, which was fearfully oppressive, passed away
with a heavy fire from the enemy.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 19th.</i>&mdash;Dreadful heat: cloudy, but no rain.
Enemy fired round shot all the morning. About
half-past 9 a large shot passed through a room in the
Residency, in which the officers were at breakfast,
fracturing the leg of Lieutenant Harmer, 32nd Foot,
but providentially injuring no one else; about the
same time Lieutenant Arthur, 7th Cavalry, was shot
dead (through the heart) in the Cawnpore battery.
Our 18-pounder fired several shots, and we threw
several shells. The enemy seemed to be at work at
the Muchee Bhawun, probably looking for shot
which had been buried in the ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
About 12 o'clock to-day the enemy sounded the
advance, and threatened an attack on the Redan.
A few shells, however, soon made them give up all
idea of coming on. They got into Johannes' house
in force, and fired steadily into the cook-house of
the brigade mess.</p>

<p>Much drunkenness prevailed amongst a few of
the garrison, who had stolen quantities of liquor,
which could not be discovered. From the commencement
of the siege, the large quantities of
liquor in the hands of the merchants caused much
anxiety, and every possible endeavour was made to
get it all into safe custody. One or two alarms
during the early part of the night. Mr. Polehampton
(wounded and in hospital) died this day from cholera.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 20th.</i>&mdash;From midnight the enemy remained
unusually quiet, and at daylight all seemed much as
usual. About half-past 8 <small>A.M.</small> it was reported that a very
large body of men could be seen marching about in
different directions within a few hundred yards of our
position. A sharp look-out was kept, and the garrison
stood to their arms. At a quarter-past 10, the
enemy sprung a mine inside the water gate, and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
twenty-five yards from our inner defences: the explosion
was great, and was evidently intended to have
blown up our Redan battery, and also to act as a
signal; for immediately the dust and smote subsided,
a very heavy fire of round shot was commenced from
every gun that the enemy possessed, followed immediately
almost by a terrific fire of musketry, under
which the enemy made an attempt to storm the
Redan and Innes' house. The garrison were ready,
and every one at his post, and the attack was coolly
met and repulsed; however the enemy advanced boldly
and came up within twenty-five yards of the battery
in immense force, but were unable to withstand the
fire of our men.</p>

<p>They made a similar attempt on Innes' house,
but were similarly repulsed by the garrison, consisting
of twelve men of the 32nd, twelve of the
13th Native Infantry, and a few uncovenanted
gentlemen, under Ensign Loughnan (who distinguished
himself greatly): very great loss was inflicted
on the enemy, who repeatedly tried to advance,
but were driven back each time with much slaughter.
Finding their efforts useless, the enemy fell back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
and contented themselves with throwing in a terrific
storm of musketry; from which we shielded
our men as much as possible, by keeping them laid
under our defences. Almost at the same time an
attack was made on the Cawnpore Battery, but the
enemy's standard-bearer (who advanced bravely)
being shot in the ditch of the battery, the rest fell
back. The enemy now moved towards Lieutenant
Anderson's house and Captain Germon's post, with
scaling-ladders, but were well received and fell back
with much loss. The attack was now over, though
for the rest of the day, until 4 <small>P.M.</small>, the enemy threw
in a heavy fire; when it gradually subsided: the
attack was mostly confined to the points above noted.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they succeeded in making a lodgment
in some pucka cook-houses inside our abattis,
and began to use a crowbar, which was distinctly
heard. We made a hole through to them from above,
through which they fired, injuring no one; but on
our throwing down some hand grenades, they fled
across the road, two being shot by the officers who
were watching from above. The 13th, 71st, and
48th sepoys all behaved well, and the manner in
which the outposts were held, was beyond all praise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
The uncovenanted distinguished themselves greatly.
We had fortunately only four men killed, and some
twelve wounded: Captain Forbes, Lieutenant Grant,
Lieutenant Edmonstone, and Mr. Hely, were
wounded. All were under arms from eight in the
morning until eight at night, and greatly fatigued
and worn out.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 21st.</i>&mdash;All very quiet during the night. The
enemy were probably fatigued with their exertions
yesterday, for throughout the night only a few round
shot were thrown in. About 10 <small>A.M.</small> the enemy
lodged themselves in some force in the low buildings
between the Seikh courtyard and Mr. Gubbins's
post, but were driven out by a few shells, and were
fired on by the officers of the brigade mess, as they
ran across a small lane: they did not attempt to
reoccupy the position during the day. About 12
o'clock, Major Banks was killed by a musket-shot
through the head, as he was reconnoitring from the
top of an outhouse. Mr. Gubbins's garrison was
fired on smartly during the morning, and many
round shot were sent into Mr. Gubbins's house;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
the garrison of which had many alarms during the
day. Painful boils very prevalent. A dreadful stench
pervaded the place in consequence of the number of
dead horses and bullocks, which, lying direct under
the fire of the enemy, we were unable to remove.
Excessive heat, and several cases of cholera. Great
fatigue; no news. Poor Dr. Brydon severely
wounded in Mr. Gubbins's house. Two Europeans
killed, and two wounded; also one of the 13th sepoys.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 22nd.</i>&mdash;Very heavy rain began to fall at 1
<small>A.M.</small>, and continued till 8 <small>A.M.</small>, when it cleared off.
During the heavy rain, the enemy only fired slightly.
After 8 <small>A.M.</small> it became more brisk, and they fired
several round shot, but were not very active during
the forenoon. Cholera still prevalent. Our numerical
strength much diminished, as we had had
151 casualties in the 32nd Regiment alone. The
enemy moved the 8-inch howitzer from its old
position, and brought it across the river by elephants,
with a tumbril behind it. Up to this date, we had
no intelligence of any kind from any quarter, and,
indeed, we had received none since the 27th ultimo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
Many messengers were sent with letters, but not a
single line did we receive in reply. A letter was
sent off to Cawnpore to-day, and conveyed by a
man named Ram Singh, a Seikh subadar of the
63rd Native Infantry. The enemy steadily loop-holing
all the houses close round about, and evidently
up to some new attempt at our position.</p>

<p>At dusk heavy rain; we got out a strong working
party, and opened our large powder magazine, and
after much labour and exertion got up 150 barrels
out of the 240 we had buried. The night was pitch
dark, and the rain fell heavily, and the work being
outside of our entrenchment, over which all the
barrels had to be handed out of mud knee deep,
rendered the work fearfully fatiguing. Many of the
officers and civilians worked for five hours at this
work. Only a few shots during the night. Boils
still very prevalent. A Seikh from the cavalry
deserted. One or two cases of cholera. Mortification
having set in, Mr. Hely's arm was amputated.</p>

<p>The buildings outside Mr. Gubbins's position were
shelled at sunset, and after we had driven the enemy
out, we made a sortie through the wall (in which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
had cut a large hole), and rushed out and examined
the houses in which the enemy had been. We
failed to find any trace of mining. We lost one
man of the 32nd, killed. Mrs. Dorin was killed
dead by a musket ball in Mr. Gubbins's house to-day.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 23rd.</i>&mdash;Very heavy rain during the night.
About 2 <small>A.M.</small> the enemy sounded the "turn out,"
and at 3 the "assembly." About 1 <small>A.M.</small> a native
pensioner, who left us on the 27th to gain information,
came in, and said he had been confined by the
enemy thirteen days, but had been to Cawnpore and
left it two days ago,&mdash;that a British force with twelve
guns was there; that they had fought three times
with the Nana's troops, and had completely beaten
them, taking many guns, and that they were crossing
the river preparatory to advancing to our assistance.
He stated that he had not brought a
letter, for fear of being detained by the enemy; he
vouched to the truth of his statement, declined a
pecuniary reward, and was urgent to go back
quickly while it rained heavily and all was quiet
comparatively. He left in two hours, taking a
small note for the officer commanding the forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
At daylight there were fewer of the enemy than
we had yet seen about, and those less active; though
they still fired smartly all around. Stench from
dead animals in some parts dreadful; as we had very
few servants of any kind and our fighting men
were so few and so harassed, that we were helpless
to bury them. Heavy showers both day and night,
keeping the garrison constantly drenched to the
skin, and making all most uncomfortable; particularly
as few had a change of clothes. Enemy fired
slackly during the afternoon. Cannonaded their
bridge of boats, which was broken by our 18-pounder
shot. Several cases of smallpox. Sick
and wounded much crowded. The upper story of
the hospital being under fire of round shot, the
wounded were, from the commencement of the siege,
confined to the ground floor, which with difficulty
contained their beds. At night it rained hard; and
in spite of all difficulties, we succeeded in getting
up the remaining ninety barrels of powder, and
safely deposited them in the centre of our position.
A false alarm about 12 o'clock at night, that the
enemy had got into the churchyard.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></div>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 24th.</i>&mdash;Morning fair and cloudy. The
enemy endeavoured to repair the bridge of boats,
but were prevented by the fire of our 18-pounder.
The heat and stench terrible, and the flies were
beyond endurance, contesting every particle of food
with us, and preventing all attempts at rest during
the day. Only a few round shot thrown, but the
enemy actively at work about forty yards from the
Redan battery, in a deep trench. Advantage taken
of the temporary lull to repair some of our defences,
which had sunk a great deal in consequence of the
heavy rain; but our men, reduced in numbers and
harassed to death day and night, were not capable
of any prolonged exertion. Every possible effort
was made to grind wheat, and from twenty-five
to thirty hand-mills were kept steadily at work,
producing an average of twenty maunds of flour
daily. The 48th Regiment Native Infantry have
had seven, and the 71st Regiment, upwards of fifty
desertions, since the commencement of the siege.</p>

<p>About dusk, the enemy, for the first time, sent in
many shells; which, however, caused no loss, fortunately.
The commissariat department busy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
the stores, getting ghee up from the Round House;
while a fatigue party of officers, under Captain
Radcliffe, threw up earth, and heightened the
traverse across the road, near the Post-office gate.
Lieutenant Hutchinson, of the Engineers, accompanied
by Lieutenant Birch, crept down in the dark,
and examined, as well as they could, the enemy's
works in the immediate vicinity of the Redan.
Night dark and cloudy.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 25th.</i>&mdash;The night passed away tolerably
quietly; the enemy firing several 18-pound shot
into the Cawnpore battery. At daylight they were
tolerably quiet, contenting themselves with musketry;
but about 8 <small>A.M.</small> they fired an 8-inch shell, which fell
through the centre of the roof of the Post-office, and
lodged on the table on which the officers of that post
breakfasted; fortunately it did not explode, and no
mischief was done. Immediately after, several shells,
apparently thrown out of mortars, were thrown in,
and continued to be so during the forenoon. One
fell in the verandah of the Post-office, and shattered
the hand of an artilleryman. Two men of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
32nd were shot this morning by the enemy's sharp-shooters.
Still not one word of intelligence from
any quarter, though this was now the twenty-sixth
day we had been besieged. We knew nothing; but
the most absurd rumours were afloat amongst the
natives, and indeed among many of the Europeans,
who were credulous enough to believe them. Removed
the powder out of the place in which we had
it, to a tykhana under the Begum Kotee which the
engineers considered safer than where it was first
removed to. Very slight firing on the river side,
but the enemy still very active near the Redan.
Much difference of opinion existed as to the object
of the work; the majority believed that they were
mining, while the engineers thought they were only
making a trench. Although the earlier part of the
morning had been quiet enough, towards 11 and 12
o'clock, a very sharp fire was opened and maintained
on the side of the Post-office and Cawnpore battery.</p>

<p>The casualties on this side alone amounted to
six, besides three others in different places, which
made the total of the day's casualties one of the
heaviest on record. Towards evening the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
commenced shelling us. Seven shells were sent in,
but did no damage. Opinions differed whether
they were discharged from howitzers or mortars.</p>

<p>About 11 <small>P.M.</small> a pensioner, who had been sent out
from this on the 22nd instant with a letter, effected
his entrance into Mr. Gubbins's compound, and produced
a letter which he had brought back from the
camp. He was at once brought to Brigadier Inglis
and examined. The letter proved to be one from
Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser Tytler, Quartermaster-General
with General Havelock's force. It was
determined to transmit to General Havelock by this
man a plan of our position and of the roads approaching
it, with memoranda drawn up by the
engineers.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 26th.</i>&mdash;At daybreak cloudy and sultry: enemy
tolerably quiet, but about 8 <small>A.M.</small> they threw in several
shells. From 11 to 1 very heavy rain, and a partial
cessation from firing, during which Lieutenant Lewin
of the Artillery, who was reconnoitring from the Cawnpore
battery, was shot dead by one of the enemy's
sharp-shooters. Enemy recommenced shelling from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
the city side: few of them to be seen, all being under
cover. Supposed to be mining at the Cawnpore battery.
A countermine commenced by us, out of the
house next the battery; but having no workmen except
our harassed soldiers, the work was slow; however,
as the engineers seemed to entertain little or no
doubt but that the enemy were mining, it was necessary
to endeavour to counteract them. Little musketry
fire during the afternoon; the enemy throwing
in heavy shot, fired at a great elevation (apparently
out of howitzer). One or two cases of cholera.
Garrison in good spirits at the prospect of early relief.</p>

<p>A letter and plan of our position forwarded at night
by a messenger to the officer commanding the relieving
force: 5000 rupees promised the messenger if he
brought a reply. Suddenly at 10 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy
commenced a heavy fire along the whole of the city
front of our position; but nothing came of it, as after
a few shells had been thrown amongst them, their
fire gradually subsided, and all became tolerably quiet
again. During this heavy firing, a sad accident
occurred; Lieutenant Shepherd of the 7th Cavalry
being shot dead in the brigade square, by a shot fired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
from the top of the brigade mess by one of our
garrison. This was the only casualty of the night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 27th.</i>&mdash;From midnight all quiet, save the
usual musketry fire. Cloudy, sultry weather. About
7 <small>A.M.</small> two planks were observed laid across the road
in front of Johannes' house. They were not seen the
night before, and being carefully watched, a man's
hand was seen coming up from below; and soon after
some eight feet of earth fell in, showing the direction
of a mine of the enemy right across the road, and
pointing direct for our stockade, within six feet of
which it had apparently reached. This was a most
fortunate discovery for us: they had evidently kept
this mine too near the surface, and the heavy rain had
broken it in. Our mine continued to be pushed on as
rapidly as possible, and our sharp-shooters from the
top of the brigade mess kept up so hot a fire on the
enemy's sap from above, that they could make no attempt
to repair the mischief. Much fever prevalent,
consequent on being constantly wet day and night.</p>

<p>Towards the afternoon, the enemy again covered
their trench with boards; but we got a mortar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
under our wall, and after one or two failures, a shell
fell right into the hole and blew all the planks away,
leaving the remains of the trench exposed to view,
giving us no further anxiety. Fine weather in the
afternoon. Enemy heard mining towards the brigadier
mess; on which a shaft was commenced by the officers,
and the enemy ceased working. Late in the evening,
the enemy were very distinctly heard mining towards
the Seikh lines; on which the Seikhs, under Lieutenant
Hardinge, commenced and sunk an eight feet
shaft; hearing us, the enemy seemed to stop working.
All quiet, with the exception of the usual
amount of firing. Fever, diarrh&oelig;a, dysentery, and
painful boils, from constant wet and exposure, still
prevalent amongst the garrison. Mrs. Grant (wife
of Lieutenant Grant) died of cholera. Captain
Boileau, 7th Cavalry, was wounded to-day.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 28th.</i>&mdash;Much shouting and bugling amongst
the enemy during the early part of the morning:
heavy rain at daylight. Made repairs to the Redan
battery, also made a small field work for a 9-pounder.
Sickness much increased, and for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
days past only one engineer officer was available for
duty: hard work, privation, and exposure day and
night to wet and heat, few could long stand against.
We had no further news of our coming friends, but
trusted that to-day they would reach Bunnee.</p>

<p>The enemy threw in several shells, also a number
of stink-pots, which were a very curious composition
of large pieces of our exploded iron shell sewn up in
canvas, and surrounded by flax and resin, with dry
powder in the centre: these, from the commencement
of the siege, had been thrown in daily from a howitzer;
they made a fearful hissing noise and great
stench, and finally exploded. They were not very
dangerous, unless they exploded <i>very</i> close to a
person. We also had a few rockets thrown in, but
not many; and lately a number of shrapnel shells,
fired apparently from a howitzer with a very great
elevation. The enemy's miners could now be distinctly
heard working close to the Seikh Square sap.</p>

<p>The room in the Residency containing the jewellery
and valuables belonging to the late King of Oude, was
broken into last night by some of the garrison, and
most of them stolen. Enemy tolerably quiet in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
afternoon. About 5 <small>P.M.</small> our sap in the Seikh Square,
which had been going on as fast as we could push it
in the direction of the enemy's, met theirs, which they
continued to work to the last moment. On our crowbar,
however, going through into their gallery, they
instantly fled out of it, and commenced to fill in their
shaft. We immediately made use of their gallery,
and blew the whole up with 100 lbs. of powder,
which brought down all the adjacent houses, &amp;c.
After this the enemy tolerably quiet. Good progress
made in our Cawnpore sap.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 29th.</i>&mdash;A fine moonlight night. Enemy
fired many round shot about daylight, and also
musketry from the houses across the road; they
also threw in many carcases, which nearly all fell in
the vicinity of the Cawnpore battery. No intelligence.
All were anxious for the relieving force,
which we thought could not be far off. Our
Cawnpore sap loaded with 200lbs. of powder, ready
to explode whenever it might be thought most
advisable. Colonel Halford, 71st Regiment Native
Infantry, who had been long ill, died this morning.</p>

<p>A few convalescents joined the ranks, giving more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
room in the hospital, which was greatly overcrowded
in consequence of all the patients being obliged to
be kept on the ground floor, as also the state
prisoners and their servants; the round shot passing
so frequently through the upper story as to make
it impossible to make use of it. Rumour stated
that the enemy had gone out in force to meet our
coming army, and had left two or three regiments
of infantry, and a body of military police, to keep
us in; but it was most difficult to tell what force
we had opposed to us, as the enemy seldom or never
showed in any number, but kept in the houses under
cover, occasionally yelling, bugling, and throwing in
a heavy fire, then subsiding into the usual steady
fire which went on night and day.</p>

<p>Firing of cannon heard in the direction of Cawnpore.
We hoped it was our friends. All anxious, but
all conjecture. Enemy recommenced mining towards
our mine in the Cawnpore battery. About 6 <small>P.M.</small>,
a heavy firing was heard for about five minutes in
the road from Cawnpore, and in about half an hour,
several guns were heard in the direction of cantonments;
this made us think it was a salute fired by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
the enemy for some reason or other; probably
to reassure themselves. However, all is conjecture;
but it threw our garrison into a great state of
excitement, and many (indeed most) stoutly maintained
it was our force. About 300 or 400 sepoys
were seen at the same time running across the
iron bridge towards cantonments in great haste.
We fired two shots at them with an 18-pounder.</p>

<p>The excitement gradually cooled down; the enemy
keeping up their usual fire. Another mine was
discovered this evening, by a portion of it falling in:
it was running in the direction of Sago's house.
Lieutenant Grant of the Bombay army, whose wife
and child died a few days ago of cholera, died in
hospital this night, from the effects of his wound:
his right hand had been blown off by a hand-grenade.
A fine moonlight night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 30th.</i>&mdash;From 2 <small>A.M.</small> till daylight heavy
rain. Enemy got in close under the wall of the
Seikh lines, and began some kind of operations
against it; they were so close that no musket
could be fired, being under a projecting piece of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
wall; they were, however, dislodged by a few
pistol shots, and ran off. No further incident occurred
during the night, beyond that there was the
usual amount of firing into our position, and bugling
on the part of the enemy. After daylight enemy
fired slackly. Terrible stench in many parts of
the garrison from half-buried corpses and animals,
which we had no time or means to bury properly.
Several cases of fever, cholera, and smallpox.</p>

<p>About 9 <small>A.M.</small> a number of sepoys and matchlockmen
were seen coming along the Cawnpore road,
and for about an hour and a half a continuous stream
of men came in in detached parties of twenty and
thirty: some sepoys were among them. Slack
firing during the forenoon, only a few shells and
musketry. In the afternoon, heavy rain for an
hour. Unable to discover what the enemy were
about. Considerable progress made in a sap, which
we had sunk in an outhouse close to the corner of
the brigade mess-house, where most of the children
and ladies were located. At first the enemy were
heard mining towards us, but since yesterday we
had not heard them. We continued, however, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
steadily push our sap, hoping either to come across
that of the enemy or succeed in getting under
Johannes' house; from which they fired all day long
on any one who showed himself. Yesterday an
artillery sergeant, who incautiously crossed the
road commanded from Johannes' house, was shot
through both legs. The enemy had many riflemen,
and some of them were most expert shots, firing
through our loopholes.</p>

<p>About 8 <small>P.M.</small>, as Captain Wilson, Lieutenant
Barwell, Lieutenant James, and Mr. Lawrence were
sitting on the chubootra of the Begum Kotee, a shell
came in and exploded as it struck the parapet of
the wall under which they sat, bringing it down.
Lieutenant James, who was lying wounded on his
bed, had a most wonderful escape. A large piece
of masonry, weighing upwards of a hundred weight,
fell on his bed, breaking it to pieces, and bringing
him down on the ground; but he was uninjured.
Mr. Lawrence received a severe contusion on the
back and head from falling masonry; and this was
the extent of the damage. Mrs. Clarke, wife of
Lieutenant Clarke of the 21st Native Infantry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
died this evening: bad food, privation, confinement,
and smells of all kinds, worked their effects.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>July 31st.</i>&mdash;A fine night, and the usual firing.
At daylight, the enemy commenced firing heavily
on the Church and Residency, from a 24-pounder
planted in the neighbourhood of the iron bridge.
They also threw in many shells, and fired their guns
from the Clock Tower Gate. Our 18-pounders and
mortars were employed until 10 <small>A.M.</small> in silencing the
enemy's fire. Our sap from the brigade mess made
good progress across the road, towards the outhouses
occupied by the enemy. Several children have lately
died: privation the chief cause. We had received
no information whatever since the 26th instant, the
date on which we received the only letter we had
yet received since the 27th of June. Our reinforcements
were due to-day, and their non-arrival
led us to suppose that the enemy had succeeded in
breaking down the bridge at Bunnee, and arresting
the progress of our friends. The flies dreadful,&mdash;preventing
all rest during the day, and disputing
our food with us. The enemy continued to throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
in shells all the forenoon, till 2 <small>P.M.</small> when we had a
heavy shower: after that, the firing continued as
before. In the evening we repaired our defences as
far as we could, as, owing to the heavy rain, the earth
had settled very considerably. A fine moonlight
night, and all quiet, save the usual amount of round
shot and musketry.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 1st.</i>&mdash;Still no intelligence of any kind,
which caused much anxiety, more particularly as
some of our supplies for natives were likely to be
at an end in twenty days' time. Weather very hot
and sultry; small painful boils, covering nearly the
whole body, very prevalent. Many deaths among
the children, and sickness on the increase. Great
inconvenience felt in the hospital for want of space;
the sick and wounded sadly crowded, and the
building very badly ventilated, as the lower story
was hardly safe from shots. Enemy threw in many
shells this morning, and fired unusually sharp with
their heavy guns, till about 10 <small>A.M.</small>, keeping our
guns and mortars fully employed in keeping down
their fire. Heat very great; fire gradually slackened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
off towards noon, but recommenced sharply
again about 5 <small>P.M.</small> Many round shot, shell, and
carcases came in. One of the latter fell into the
courtyard of the Begum Kotee, within a few feet
of the table at which the staff and commissariat officers
were at dinner; but no one was hurt. Several
cases of cholera occurred to-day. Efforts made to improve
and strengthen our defences during the moonlight
nights; but the engineer officers were all sick,
and little was done. Our sap in the brigade mess was
pushed steadily on, and had attained thirty-eight
feet from the shaft this evening.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;Fine moonlight night. Sharp
firing during some portion of it. Many rockets
were thrown in early in the morning. Mr. Hely of
the 7th Cavalry died this day of the wound he
received on the 20th ult. An artillery sergeant was
mortally wounded this morning in the Redan.
Enemy fired a salute of some forty guns
about 11 <small>A.M.</small> A Seikh sowar of the 3rd Irregular
Cavalry deserted to the enemy this morning. The
Bhoosa stack fell down to-day, burying ten or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
twelve bullocks; which, after much labour, were
got out. Seven of them were unfortunately dead;
thus entailing more labour, as at night we had to
bury them: no slight task in such weather, with
our jaded and harassed garrison. Towards the
evening a heavy cannonade was kept up on both
sides. About 5·30 <small>P.M.</small> an eight-inch shell from
the enemy struck the Begum Kotee, and, breaking
right through the outside wall, exploded in the
room in which Lieutenant James of the Commissariat
and Mr. Lawrence of the Civil Service were
lying on their beds wounded, with one or two servants
in the room; providentially all escaped, though
the room was set on fire. Heavy firing till midnight.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 3rd.</i>&mdash;Smart firing till daylight. Every
possible effort was made to strengthen our position
and raise the height of our defences. A soldier of
the 32nd Foot was shot dead this morning in the
centre room of the hospital; showing how little
safety anywhere existed against the enemy's fire.</p>

<p>A new loophole on the top of the brigade mess,
which it was discovered commanded a distant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
much frequented lane in the city, was made use of
by Lieutenant Sewell, armed with his Enfield rifle;
the distance being not above 750 yards, the conical
bullets most effectually cleared the lanes of the
sepoys, as they lounged up it, and quickened the
paces of the citizens as they crossed and recrossed.</p>

<p>Enemy unusually slack in firing after dark till
about 10 <small>P.M.</small>, when they recommenced firing, and
continued it during the night. The engineers
continued their endeavours to strengthen our
position, by heightening the abattis near the Redan.
A fine moonlight night. Several cannon shots
were heard in the distance, but no intelligence of
any kind reached us.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 4th.</i>&mdash;The enemy fired a great number of
rounds from their guns at intervals during the
night. Musketry fire was slack this morning. No
news of any kind. Could get no messengers to go
out with a letter, though it was made so small that
it went into half a quill; but it had been spread
abroad that the enemy would kill any one leaving
the garrison, and this deterred any one from endeavouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
to carry a letter to our friends, no matter
how great the reward might be that was held out.</p>

<p>Many officers and men are laid up with fever and
dysentery. Our stored attah was nearly expended,
and in a few days' time we should have to commence
that which we had ground, which now amounted to
about 500 maunds. At 2 <small>P.M.</small> the firing of all
kinds was very slack; indeed, for long intervals, not
a shot was to be heard. The officers, also, who
relieve one another as look-outs on the top of the
Residency, reported that a smaller number of men
than usual were to be seen on the move. An
Eurasian attached to the party working Dr.
Fayrer's guns, was shot dead while working the
18-pounder guns this day, by a man said to be
not sixty yards off. Several convalescents have
been moved from the hospital to other quarters, and
with happy results both as regards themselves and
those left in the hospital, which greatly wanted a
free circulation of air. Towards dusk many shells
came in, and one exploded in the second brigade
square; fortunately, it was seen coming, and no
harm ensued. The powder magazine was made as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
secure as possible, by putting heavy beams across
the roof, and covering them with two feet of
earth. A fine night, but very much firing till midnight.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 5th.</i>&mdash;Sent off another letter to the officer
commanding the relieving force, of which we could
gain no intelligence; though we conjecture the advance
of our force had been arrested by the enemy
at the bridge of Bunnee. Heavy showers during
the day. Musket-proof shutters were completed
for the embrasure of the 18-pounders to the left of
the hospital. Many of the convalescent patients removed
to the Thug Gaol Barracks, which gave them
a slight change, and created more room in the hospital.
Efforts made to clear some of the drains, and
reduce the stench which pervades the garrison. At
sunset the enemy were seen at a distance in some
force, with drums and fifes playing, marching from
the direction of the river towards the Cawnpore
road. Soon after, they threw many shells into us,
and continued to do so for some time. About 8 <small>P.M.</small>
all became tolerably quiet.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 6th.</i>&mdash;The enemy fired several shots, from
a 24-pounder, at the Residency, one of which unfortunately
fractured the arm of Ensign Studdy of
the 32nd Foot, as he sat down to breakfast; rendering
amputation necessary. This gun caused us
great annoyance, from its calibre, and firing so frequently
as it did into the Residency. Unfortunately
its distance from our position, and its situation in
the midst of buildings, rendered it impossible to
take it by the bayonet; neither could our gunners
see it, so that to shell it was our only resource.</p>

<p>Less firing than usual. The enemy again ascended
into the upper story of Johannes' house, and from
thence caused much annoyance to the position of the
brigade mess, where the cooking went on. They succeeded
in killing a sweeper. Terrible heat; Brigadier
Inglis suffered from its effects. Various rumours
afloat in the garrison; some of which seemed to have
originated either with a servant of Mr. Gubbins, or
some member of his post. The Residency is at last
to be entirely vacated by the officers of the 32nd
and others now resident there. Last night was
spent in earthing in the magazine, as several shots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
had lately gone unpleasantly near, A carcase came
into the Begum Kotee in the afternoon, into the
room in which Lieutenant James (wounded), Mr.
Lawrence (wounded), and Ensign Keir (sick), were
lying; it set some of the things in the room on fire,
but was speedily extinguished without injury to any
one. Much bugling, drumming, and firing towards
evening. After dark the enemy fired heavily from
their guns in front of the Residency. Our engineers
and a working party were busy all this night at
Innes' house, making a battery for an 18-pounder, to
be moved down in order to endeavour to silence a
24-pounder of the enemy's, which had been doing
much mischief by firing through the church and
Residency. About 9 <small>P.M.</small> a sepoy of the 1st Oude
Irregular Infantry, who took out a letter to the
officer commanding the relieving force, came in;
he stated that he had delivered it, and that he had
received a letter in reply which he had lost in
coming in to us. Half-an-hour later, another man,
a sepoy of the 48th, who had been sent into the
town two days previously to try and gain intelligence,
returned, and stated he had been confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
several days by the enemy; and he in a great
measure corroborated the statement of the sepoy of
the 1st Oude Irregular Infantry: this loss of the
letter was a great mortification to us, as it might
have explained what was at this time inexplicable&mdash;the
retirement towards Cawnpore of General Havelock's
force, after apparently the greatest success on
this side the Ganges.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 7th.</i>&mdash;We worked hard at our new battery
at Innes' house, and got it ready; an 18-pounder
was taken down and in position by daylight, whence
it commenced firing, and soon silenced the enemy's
guns. The enemy, however, fired heavily from some
others, and about 8 <small>A.M.</small> a shell burst close to the
Residency and mortally wounded two of the best
men in the 32nd, the one a colour-sergeant and the
other an orderly-room clerk. Captain Waterman
of the 13th was wounded through the hand by a
musket ball at Innes' post this morning. Several
cases of cholera. Every effort made to increase the
number of men to grind wheat for the force. Exceedingly
heavy rain during the middle of the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
The hose into our mine near Johannes's house got
damped, and required all the tamping to be removed.
Our position greatly flooded, which rendered it most
wretched for those who had to be in trenches night
and day. The artillery canteen closed, in consequence
of the gross irregularities which prevailed,
and its contents removed to the canteen of the 32nd
Regiment, from which the artillery were in future
supplied. The heavy rain seemed to make the stench
which pervaded the place worse, and this evening it
was fearful. Several cases of cholera occurred to-day.
The enemy's cannon knocked down a portion
of the verandah of the Residency, also the verandah
of Delprat's house at the Cawnpore battery: a
few shells came in in the evening.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 8th.</i>&mdash;A tolerably quiet night. Dr.
McDonnell, of the 41st Native Infantry, died early
this morning of cholera. A soldier of the 32nd was
shot, and a native woman-servant of Mrs. Banks had
her thigh broken by musketry at Mr. Gubbins's post
this forenoon.</p>

<p>A heavy smoke was distinctly seen in the far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
distance in the direction of the Cawnpore road.
Many reports were made of heavy firing being
heard in the same direction: a Sikh attached to
the cavalry brought repeated accounts of it, but no
European, save Captains Forbes and Hawes, of Mr.
Gubbins's post, could say he heard it. The natives
(some of them) very anxious about the arrival of the
reinforcements, of whom we could hear nothing.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a regiment of infantry, about
600 strong, with drums beating, marching in
quarter distance column with colours, was seen
marching through the city, in the direction of the
Cawnpore road.</p>

<p>Seven hundred yards from the brigade-mess was
a street in the city which was commanded by
Lieutenant Sewell's double Enfield rifle, and on
which spot he had killed several sepoys and others:
this was this afternoon barricaded right across, which
was a nuisance, as it entirely obstructed our view of
what passed along. Lieutenant Bryce of the artillery,
who had been severely wounded, died of cholera.</p>

<p>No intelligence came in this evening, and much
anxiety as to our reinforcements was evinced by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
some of our native troops and servants. Rice
was served out to most of the natives in lieu of
flour, and wheat to the native camp-followers, in
order to husband our stock of flour. All the tea
and coffee for the Europeans expended; the last
issue being made yesterday. This was the first day
on which we had no casualty.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;The heat excessive, and children
sank rapidly under the effects of want of good air,
food and exercise: several deaths occurred among
them, both yesterday and to-day. The enemy fired
heavily in the morning, but providentially, no one
was hurt. Ensign Studdy, who had had his arm
amputated from the effects of a 24-pounder shot,
died this morning. The enemy were thought to
have recommenced mining near the Redan battery.</p>

<p>Divine service was performed in the brigade mess-house
to all officers not on duty. No signs or
symptoms of our reinforcements. In the middle of
the day Ensign Loughnan of the 13th (on duty at
Innes' house) went out with a few men and quietly
spiked a small gun of the enemy's, and returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
without any loss. A very heavy shower in the
evening, which filled our trenches. One or two
doolies were seen going across the Goomtee, accompanied
by sepoys. About 9 <small>P.M.</small> a Seikh sowar
of the 3rd Oude Irregular Cavalry came in by the
Seikh battery. His having been permitted to pass
the enemy's outposts induced a belief that he had
come in to try and make the other Seikhs desert;
consequently he was placed under British bayonets,
and not allowed to converse with any one.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 10th.</i>&mdash;About 10 <small>A.M.</small> a great number of
sepoys, probably 1600, were seen, with two guns,
marching up our left flank and across the Cawnpore
road, behind their trenches. Very shortly after, a large
force was seen to be approaching the bridge of boats
from cantonments; and, in consequence, all were
quickly at their posts. About half an hour after,
the enemy fired a shell into the Begum Kotee,
which appeared to be a signal; for the instant after,
a mine was sprung opposite to Johannes's house,
which blew in a great portion of the house occupied
by Mr. Schilling and the Martiniere boys, and entirely
destroyed our pallisades and defences for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
space of sixty feet. One of the heaviest timbers
was pitched right on the top of the brigade mess-house,
among the officers and men of the 32nd, who
occupied the post. As soon as the smoke blew
away, the enemy pushed up, under a tremendous
musketry fire, right into Johannes's house and
garden, and into all the buildings close round the
Cawnpore battery; but all their efforts to enter
our position were met with such a steady fire, that
they fell back, and kept up an incessant fire of
musketry on our defences. About thirty of them,
however, lodged themselves in the ditch of the
Cawnpore battery, within a few feet of our guns.
A hand grenade was rolled over right into the
centre of them, on which they bolted and ran back,
exposed to a sharp fusillade from our people on the
top of the brigade-mess.</p>

<p>While this was going on, a very sharp attack
was made on Mrs. Sago's house, where the enemy
blew up a mine, which destroyed some of the
outhouses and blew two soldiers out into the
road, outside our defences: extraordinary to relate,
they fell unhurt, and got safely back to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
posts. The enemy then made their attack, but
were soon driven back with considerable loss, and
confined themselves to keeping up a tremendous
storm of round shot and musketry on our position,
which after two hours, in a great measure, subsided.
About 5 <small>P.M.</small>, they made a sudden rush on Captain
Saunders's post. One of the enemy even seized a
bayonet of one of the 84th Foot, and tried to wrench
it off through a loophole, but was instantly shot;
after a smart fusillade, which lasted for about 25 minutes,
they withdrew, and gradually the fire ceased.</p>

<p>About 9 <small>P.M.</small> a third attack was made, and
was similarly repulsed; nor were these efforts confined
to the places above noted. At Innes' house,
Anderson's, and Mr. Gubbins's post, large bodies of
men came forward, bringing up large scaling-ladders,
several of which they abandoned. During the
day, we lost three Europeans and two sepoys killed,
and about twice that number wounded. Our garrison
were under arms the entire day, the heat was
excessive, and all were greatly exhausted; nevertheless,
every officer and man remained under arms
all night: after 10 o'clock all became tolerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
quiet. Captain Power, of the 32nd, who had been
wounded early in the siege, died in hospital to-day,
and Major Anderson, chief engineer, was reported
very dangerously ill. The enemy must have had
a considerable loss this day, as a great number of
them were seen to fall; and we threw 150 shells, besides
great quantities of round shot and grape, from
which also many casualties must have occurred.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 11th.</i>&mdash;A slight alarm about 2 <small>A.M.</small>, after
which all subsided into the usual routine firing. A
very fine morning, very little to be seen of the
enemy, who however were not idle, as they were
to-day busily employed constructing earthworks and
trenches in various directions close to our position.
Early in the morning the enemy fired many round
shot, some of which struck the Residency, already
much shattered; and about noon a very distressing
accident took place. There was a high wind, and it
brought down a great portion of the left wing, on
the ground floor of which, in a room, six men of the
32nd were asleep. They were completely buried in
the ruins. Two were got out alive after very great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
exertions, but the remaining four were left under
the ruins. Immediate arrangements made for the removal
of the few European women and children who
still occupied one of the rooms on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Major Anderson, chief engineer, died during the
afternoon. He had been ailing before the siege,
but on the commencement rallied somewhat, owing
to the excitement and novelty of the position.
Latterly he fell off again, and to-day expired; his
death no doubt hastened by the impossibility of any
change of air or diet. The look-out officers yesterday
reported having seen some few doolies going
across the river with sepoys after the day of attack,
and to-day some dead and wounded were also seen
being conveyed away. The enemy were busy close
under Mr. Gubbins's ramparts, whence they had
once before been expelled by some hand grenades.
At the corner of the Seikh square also, from across
the road, they amused themselves by pushing out
over the wall bamboos with lighted straw at the
end; but with what object was not very clear: in
the meanwhile not one of them showed themselves,
but kept well under cover. Smart firing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
evening. The corpse of a soldier of the 32nd was
extricated from the ruins of the Residency; three
others still remained.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 12th.</i>&mdash;A fine moonlight night. About 3·30
<small>A.M.</small> the enemy suddenly commenced a very heavy
fire of round shot and musketry, which lasted for
three-quarters of an hour. We kept close, and hardly
fired a shot, beyond throwing a few shells. At day
light, they commenced a very heavy cannonade
and musketry fire on the Cawnpore battery; this
gradually became so sharp, that it was impossible
to work our guns, or even remain in the battery;
and we were obliged to withdraw every one but the
sentry, as the enemy's round shot had destroyed our
musketry shutters, and completely swept the battery:
later in the day, our sentry, the only man in
the battery, was killed by a round shot. This portion
of our position caused us great anxiety, as we
were quite unable to hold it as it should be held;
we would not withdraw our guns, for fear of giving
the enemy confidence. The enemy were busily
employed to-day also in digging close to Sago's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
house. In order to see what they were about, at
12 o'clock a sortie was made with twelve Europeans
of the 32nd Foot under Lieutenant Clery, accompanied
by Lieutenant Hutchinson of the Engineers.
The enemy were, however, well on the alert, and
had a large covering party over their work, and as
our men appeared, they threw in such a heavy fire
that our people were compelled to retire; this
brought on a very great fire from all that side of the
enemy's attack, and they kept up a smart fire of
round shot and musketry for fully an hour, when it
gradually subsided. Finding we were unequal to
meet the enemy by a sortie, we determined to push
on our mine as fast as possible, and continue working
all day and night, hoping to blow them up.</p>

<p>In the evening we had as strong working parties
of Europeans as we could afford, and removed from
the Cawnpore battery, a 9-pounder which had been
disabled by a round shot of the enemy. We also
dug a trench and threw up earth on the top of
our parapets, and endeavoured to our utmost to
repair the damage the enemy had done, and make
the place as strong as possible. Several shells came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
in after dusk. The heat throughout the day was
excessive, and there were several fatal cases of
cholera, and also several deaths among the children,
who were all greatly emaciated.</p>

<p>In the evening, a letter to General Havelock,
rolled up and put inside a quill, was despatched by the
hands of an old woman; she left our position about
9 <small>P.M.</small>, and we hoped, would be permitted to pass
the enemy's sentries without being stopped. During
the past forty-five days, we had sent by different
hands, in a similar manner, some twenty letters, to
only one of which was any reply received. The
garrison, very greatly harassed and fatigued from
continued exertion night and day and want of rest.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 13th.</i>&mdash;An excessively hot night. During
the early part of the morning the enemy threw in a
very heavy fire, which lasted for nearly half an hour,
when all subsided into the usual routine firing.</p>

<p>Our mine near Sago's house was pushed on all
night with the greatest possible speed. Every possible
means was adopted by the enemy to prevent our
miners working, and as only a wall and a few feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
of ground divided the two parties, they resorted to
squibs, rockets, brickbats, and lights at the end of
bamboos, to annoy our workmen. As the latter were
thrust forward with the hope of setting fire to our
tiled outhouses, the ends were successively cut
off by us. Several reports alive in the garrison, but
on what grounds, or how stated, no one could say.
However, as these were all more or less favourable
to us, and encouraging to the natives, if credited, no
harm was done.</p>

<p>Shortly before 10 <small>A.M.</small> the engineers reported our
countermine as ready; the neighbouring outposts and
garrisons were duly warned, and the mine fired, with
the happiest results: the brick house in which the
enemy was, and from which they had started their mine,
settled down, burying all inside; the earth was thrown
up to a considerable height, and only one outhouse
of our own, of no consequence, destroyed. Up to
the last moment, the people inside the enemy's mine
were hard at work, and after the explosion the
groans of the sufferers were plainly audible. In the
course of the day, some few of the enemy were shot
from Sago's post. In the afternoon, after several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
shells had been thrown in to drive as many out as
possible, it was determined to go out and see what
the enemy were doing near Mr. Gubbins's post. A
hole being cut in the wall out of our defences, a
party of Europeans, with the engineer officers, went
out and found a deep trench dug through the outhouses
for some distance towards our position. The
work was not deemed of any great importance, and
after it had been well examined, the party withdrew.</p>

<p>Many cases of fever to-day, and four deaths in
hospital among the Europeans. Enemy very quiet
during the evening; unusually so, till about 10 <small>P.M.</small>,
when they threw an 8-inch shell into our position.
This appeared to be a signal; for instantly they
commenced a tremendous fire with round shot and
musketry, which lasted half an hour, and completely
lit up the darkness around. They were busy mining
us in several places, and their workmen could be
distinctly heard at work. Our engineers were hard
at work, trying with the best means at their disposal
to frustrate their efforts; but our people were so
harassed that they were not capable of any prolonged
exertion. A shaft, however, for a mine was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
made in Mr. Anderson's house, and sunk to the
extent of eight feet, in view to running a sap to meet
the enemy. Heat very great, and mosquitoes, bugs,
and fleas most troublesome.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 14th.</i>&mdash;Enemy unusually quiet all the
morning; more so than they had yet been. Our
people were all busy preparing new sandbags, as
the old ones were so rotten, from long exposure to
the rain, that they would bear no removal: also in
countermining the enemy from out of a corner of
Anderson's house. A Mater came in this morning,
but could give no information. Provision for the
cattle growing short; and every means adopted to
reduce the daily consumption. The various look-outs
reported no movement of the enemy: in a word, it
was the quietest day we had yet had. About 4 <small>P.M.</small>
they began a more brisk fire. Many cases of fever
and several deaths amongst the children. Many
rumours abroad regarding our relieving force; but all
was conjecture. Most of our outpost houses were
now so riddled with round shot, that it was a wonder
how any of them stood up at all: indeed most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
them were in ruins, and at Mr. Anderson's house
part of the garrison had been twice pulled out of the
ruins which had suddenly fallen on them; nevertheless,
these posts, in spite of many casualties, were
held with the same courage and devotion as was displayed
the first day of the siege. At dusk we had
a severe thunderstorm, with exceedingly heavy rain,
which lasted for several hours, falling in a complete
deluge; the night was exceedingly dark, with extremely
vivid lightning. Captain Fulton and Lieutenant
Hutchinson of the Engineers went down and
examined all the outhouses in Dr. Fayrer's premises,
to see if any mining operations could be heard.
They afterwards went down to the Buxee Khana, and
examined the wall in front to some distance.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 15th.</i>&mdash;Heavy rain till about 3 <small>A.M.</small>, when
it cleared away, and the morning was beautifully
clear and fine. The enemy fired salvos of two and
three 18-pounders at once into the Cawnpore battery,
and brought down all the outer wall of
the house alongside it, which we used as a guardroom;
making the place so hot we were obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
retire our men from it during the heaviest part of
the cannonade. Lieutenant Bonham received a
severe contusion, from bricks knocked out on him
by an 18-pound shot; and later in the day the sentry
left in the front part of the battery was killed by a
round shot. Lieutenant James Alexander was shot
through the arm while laying an 18-pounder in the
Hospital battery. Several servants and six bheesties
of the 32nd deserted last night. At night, advantage
taken of the dark to repair as much as possible
the damage done to-day to the Cawnpore battery.
About 9 <small>P.M.</small> a pensioner named Ungud, who had
been sent out with a letter, returned, bringing a
letter from Cawnpore. This was the first night
since the siege began that no burial took place.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 16th.</i>&mdash;Great progress made in our mine
out of Lieutenant Anderson's house, which had
now reached a distance of twenty-five feet from the
shaft. Also much done in the way of making the
Cawnpore battery more secure. Brigadier Inglis
slept in it himself. In the early morning the
enemy fired a great many round shot, and brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
a new gun into position, to play on the corner of
the brigade mess-house; also one which fired on
Mr. Gubbins's post, but which was soon silenced by
a 9-pounder placed in position against it. Divine
service performed in the brigade-mess to a few
officers who were off duty, and to the ladies. Much
round shot fired during the day, but fewer
sepoys in sight than usual. Every possible effort
was made to curtail the expenditure of our provisions,
and make them last as long as possible.
The enemy threw in three 8-inch shells during the
evening, and fired several round shot during the
night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 17th.</i>&mdash;The remaining portion of the
Residency was deemed unsafe by the engineers,
from the number of round shot that had come
through it; and arrangements were made to remove
the Europeans. The heat extreme, a heavy cannonade
from daylight till 9 <small>A.M.</small>, when it gradually
slackened. A few round shot were fired through
the Residency during the morning. Much progress
was made in the mine out of Lieutenant Anderson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
house, and a new shaft sunk in the Martiniere
School, in view to running a sap towards Johannes'
house. The Seikhs mined well, and the payment in
cash of two rupees per man for each night's work
made the work popular. Between 4 and 5 <small>P.M.</small> the
enemy recommenced a slight cannonade, doubtless
stirred up by some shells which were thrown during
the afternoon. Towards dusk the enemy threw in
several shells, and at midnight an 8-inch, which
nearly hit our laboratory.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 18th.</i>&mdash;At daylight the enemy exploded
a large mine under one of our principal posts in
the outer square, occupied by the Seikhs; the
three officers and three sentries on the top of
the house, were blown up into the air and fell
among the debris. The guard below were all, however,
buried in the ruins, and lost their lives: they
were two bandsmen of the 41st, two of the 13th,
and a sepoy of the 48th Native Infantry. The
officers, though much stunned, on recovering themselves
ran away, and all three escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>When the smoke had blown away, we discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
that a clear breach had been made into our defences,
to the extent of thirty feet in breadth. One of the
enemy's leaders sprung on the top of the breach,
brandishing his sword and calling on others to
follow; but he fell dead instantly from the flank fire
of the officers on the top of the brigade-mess.
Another instantly followed and shared the same
fate, when the rest of the force declined making a
home rush. On the first springing of the mine, our
garrison was at once under arms, and the reserve of
the 84th Foot (eighteen men) were immediately sent
down and placed in a position which commanded the
breach from the right; while boxes, doors, planks,
tents, &amp;c., were rapidly carried down to make as
much cover as possible to protect our men against
musketry: also a house was pulled down and a road
made for a gun; and, after incredible exertions, a
9-pounder was got into a position which commanded
all the breach, and was loaded with a double
charge of grape. The enemy, by means of some
barricaded lanes, contrived to creep up and get
possession of the right flank wall of the Seikh
square; but our mortar and a 24-pounder howitzer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
drove the main body off, and a sudden rush
at noon cleared away the rest. We reoccupied all
the ground we had lost in the morning, and also
took possession of the houses previously held by the
enemy, and which were situated between the Seikh
square and Mr. Gubbins's house. No time was lost
in destroying them, and by sunset 400lbs. of gunpowder
had cleared away many of the houses from
which the enemy had most annoyed us. By this
time the breach was securely barricaded against any
sudden rush, and at night a working party completed
it. In addition to the eight men lost in the
explosion, we had this day one of the 32nd killed,
and a volunteer (M. De Prât) and three of the 32nd
wounded. Nothing could exceed the zeal with
which <i>all</i> the natives worked to secure the breach,
and make a road for a gun. The heat was fearful,
and this was one of the most harassing days we had,
all ranks being hard at work from daylight till dark,
under a dreadful sun. Lieutenant Fletcher, 48th
Regiment Native Infantry, on look-out duty at the
top of the Residency, was shot through the arm,
and had his telescope shivered by a rifle-ball, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
reconnoitring. Lieutenant Graham was also hit on the
chest with a spent ball. For further accounts of the
explosion of the mine, see the report of the disaster
by an eye-witness, marked (II.) in the Appendix.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 19th.</i>&mdash;The enemy rather lively with
their large guns this morning. Firing more particularly
at the guard-rooms on the top of the
brigade-mess, which were by this time well-riddled.
About 2 <small>P.M.</small> the engineers, Messrs. Fulton, Hutchinson,
and Anderson, with a small party, went
out on the premises which we yesterday seized, for
the purpose of blowing up some more houses and
buildings. This party was supported by some Europeans
and Seikhs, kept inside the square. The
enemy showed nowhere, and save for a few dropping
shots, their presence would not have been known.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, that even through the Pucka
buildings, the enemy dug communicating trenches,
probably to escape the effects of our shells; which,
however, they had not always been successful in
doing, as several pools of blood showed us. In the
afternoon we experienced a smart cannonade, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
about dusk had a heavy shower which stayed it for
a while, and after 8 <small>P.M.</small> it subsided nearly entirely
into a musketry fire.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 20th.</i>&mdash;A heavy fire of musketry towards
daylight, when the enemy began the heaviest cannonade
we had yet had; particularly on the Cawnpore
battery, in front of which they had put another
gun in position. For three hours they fired continually,
and a great portion of Mons. De Prât's
house fell in. Their round shot came in through the
Thug Jail, and enfiladed it; fortunately it struck
high, and no casualty occurred: they also threw
some shrapnel, as yesterday. Our guard rooms on
the top of the brigade mess were now entirely demolished
by round shot, which came through them
almost unceasingly. An 8-inch shell went into the
Residency, and exploded on the staircase. A
soldier of the 32nd Foot was killed in the 18-pounder
battery, at Dr. Fayrer's, by a musket-ball
which struck him in the head. We were busy
all night at our mine, which was now completed, and
we hope to be able to load it and have it ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
fire by daylight to-morrow morning. Many men
were seen in the early part of the day, moving about
in the bazaar (most of them sepoys). It was difficult
to say what they were about, as they were
moving both ways. Lieutenant Cunliffe of the artillery
was slightly wounded this morning in the
knee by a musket ball. Great mortality amongst
the children in the garrison, and a great deal of
sickness prevailed, particularly fever. All the tea
and sugar for the Europeans had been for some time
expended, save a small supply which had been reserved
for the use of the sick and wounded. The enemy
again commenced to undermine the lane running
from the Cawnpore battery behind the brigade-mess,
and were also engaged in some other work to the
right of Johannes' house. Much firing during the
evening. Captain Lowe of the 32nd Foot, had a
very narrow escape; an eight-inch shell burst close
to him in the trenches, and slightly wounded him
in the hand, and cut off the arm of a soldier alongside
him. The enemy made an attempt to burn
down the gates at the Baillie Guard, by eluding the
vigilance of the sentries and piling up logs of wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
and combustibles outside the gate. It burnt fiercely,
but was soon extinguished by the water-carriers
of the 13th, without damage to the gates: the fire
was the signal for a heavy fusillade, which lasted
nearly half an hour.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 21st.</i>&mdash;At daybreak all was prepared and
ready for the blowing-up of our mine, and the simultaneous
sortie of fifty Europeans under Captain
M'Cabe and Lieutenant Browne (divided into two
parties), for the purpose of spiking the enemy's
guns which fired into the mess house, and in
order to hold Johannes' house while the engineer
officers blew it up. Precisely at 5 <small>P.M.</small> the mine,
containing 400 lbs. of powder, was sprung, and as
soon as the dust and smoke had in a measure subsided,
the party ran out, drove the enemy (who were
taken by surprise, and made but a slight show of
resistance) from their guns (two), and spiked them
both, and retained possession of Johannes' house,
while the engineers made arrangements for blowing it
up. These were soon completed, and the party withdrawn.
A slow match was applied, and the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
laid in ruins. Our losses were one of the 84th killed,
one sergeant (84th) mortally wounded, one of the
32nd dangerously wounded, one slightly wounded,
and a sergeant of the artillery killed. The operation
was entirely successful, and rid us of a house
from which the enemy had, from the commencement
of the siege, annoyed us greatly. Captain
Barlow, of the 50th Native Infantry, died somewhat
suddenly in hospital this morning. The grass and
jungle all round had grown to a very great height,
and would have given cover to a number of men to
approach close up to our position unobserved. In
the afternoon, a boy about twelve years of age was
seen close to the Baillie Guard gate, picking up
bullets that had been fired. A sepoy of the 13th
on sentry-duty saw him, covered him with his
musket, and compelled him to come in. An eight-inch
shell fell on the top of the Residency about
9 <small>P.M.</small>, and exploded, fortunately without injuring
any one.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 22nd.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Green, of the 48th Native
Infantry, died early this morning. There had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
also many deaths among children during the few
previous days. Many of our supplies were entirely
expended, and the garrison were put to great inconvenience
for the want of tobacco, of which for some
time past there had been none to issue. Still more
stringent measures adopted to prevent the consumption
of flour; and wheat was issued to all non-combatants
who had time to grind it. A fine clear
night, with less musketry and more cannon firing than
usual. Many of our defences were greatly injured
from the late heavy rain and the incessant cannonade
of the enemy. Last night repairs were made to the
Cawnpore and Redan batteries, both of which still
required much to be done to them. To-day an
European sentry inside the Baillie Guard gate, was
shot dead by a rifleman: the ball went through
some sand bags put up for his protection. A sepoy
of the 13th was also hit in the knee this morning from
the same loophole. Arrangements were made to
knock the place down to-morrow morning at daylight
with a 24-pounder howitzer. Sergeant Ryder, of the
artillery, was killed dead by a musket ball to-day in the
churchyard. Up to this date, we had lost since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
siege commenced on the 30th of June, by killed,
wounded, and sickness: 101 men of the 32nd Foot,
not including officers; and of the detachment of the
84th, consisting originally of fifty men, eleven had been
killed and died of wounds and disease since the above
date. Reports of distant firing being heard, vague
rumours were afloat; but these excited little attention
<i>now</i>, so often had they been in circulation, giving
rise to false hopes of our reinforcements being near.</p>

<p>Captain Hawes, of the 63rd Native Infantry, was
wounded this afternoon by a musket ball through the
side and arm, while on the look-out from the top of
the defences at Mr. Gubbins's post. After dark we
had two eight-inch shells and several shrapnell sent
in. One of the former carried off the leg of a native
(who died soon after), and slightly wounded another.
Repairs continued in the Cawnpore and Redan batteries.
The want of tea and sugar much felt, and
very large prices offered for stores of any kind.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 23rd.</i>&mdash;A heavy cannonade from the
enemy, from daylight till about 10 <small>P.M.</small>, when it
slackened. Their principal efforts were against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
brigade-mess house and Cawnpore battery; the
former they seriously damaged, and succeeded in
entirely levelling the guard-houses on the top;
both of which had fallen in, and there was no longer
any cover for our musketry to fire from. Our ranks
were rapidly thinning. Two men were again this
morning mortally wounded by musketry fire. The
enemy were busily employed in digging on all sides,
more particularly in front of the Redan; but it was
very difficult to say what their object was, as they
dug deep trenches in all directions. Continued
reports of distant firing being heard. The enemy
fired heavily from their guns in the afternoon, and
did considerable damage to our defences. A working
party employed after dark, making a magazine
for the powder and shells lodged in the Post-office.</p>

<p>We had work nightly for at least 300 men; as we
had the defences to repair daily, supplies to remove
from godowns which were fallen in from the effects
of the enemy's shot, mines to countermine, guns
to remove, barricades to erect, corpses to bury, and
rations to serve out; but with our weak, harassed,
and daily diminishing garrison, we could seldom produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
as working parties more than three fatigue
parties of eight or ten men each relief; and the
Europeans were capable of but little exertion, as
from want of sleep, hard work night and day, and
constant exposure, their bodily strength was greatly
diminished. The enemy threw in an 8-inch shell
about 9 <small>P.M.</small> and fired all the evening. Divine service
was performed at the brigade-mess in the
morning, and in the afternoon, at Dr. Fayrer's; the
sacrament was administered on both occasions.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 24th.</i>&mdash;This morning, at about 2 o'clock,
the enemy opened a very heavy fire, both of round
shot and musketry; commencing and concluding the
same apparently on the signal of a fireball thrown up
on each occasion. The Judicial Garrison house,
under command of Captain Germon, being in a most
dangerous state from the effects of round shot, all
the women and wounded men, also children, were
removed from that post, as well as from all the other
outposts in that quarter, into the Begum Kotee in
the neighbourhood. A sergeant of the 84th was
dangerously wounded coming up from Mrs. Sago's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
house, by a sharp-shooter. Lieutenant Bonham, of
the artillery, was busily employed perfecting his
arrangements for using an 8-inch mortar as a
howitzer. The experiment succeeded very well
yesterday evening.</p>

<p>The verandah of the Residency on the west side
came entirely down this morning. The commissariat
stores in the godown underneath were removed
in the evening, as some of the arches of the lower
story were cracked, and a heavy cannonade would
have brought the whole place down. Arrangements
were made this day for still further reducing the
rations of Europeans. A kitmutghar came in from
the city last night: his account was so suspicious,
that he was placed under an European guard, as he
might have tampered with the natives. To-day we
threw two shells a long way into the city, in the
direction of the palace. The enemy tolerably
quiet; towards the middle of the day confining
themselves to sharp-shooting at every one they saw
move about in our position. Mr. MacRae of the
Civil Engineer Department was very badly hit in
the shoulder this afternoon, while assisting in laying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
a mortar in the Post-office; and a sergeant and a
private were badly wounded early in the day, while
going to their post. The enemy possessed many
excellent rifle shots, and fired out of their loopholes
from the houses around with great certainty; occasioning
us a daily loss of from three to five men.
Two sepoys of the 13th were also slightly wounded
by random shots before daybreak this morning.
Several shells came in this evening; and about
12 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy opened a tremendous fire on all
sides, of round shot, grape, and musketry, which
lasted for an hour: the fire was very heavy, but
they made no effort to storm, though their bugles
sounded the advance repeatedly.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 25th.</i>&mdash;There was the usual heavy cannonade
this morning from the enemy, which continued
from 5 to 9 <small>A.M.</small>, when it slackened. All
the remaining porter in store (thirty-nine casks)
was got out of the Residency, and removed to
another place, consequent on the unsafe state of the
building; nearly one half of which had fallen from
round shot, and the remaining portion was likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
to follow. The magazine for the Post-office battery
completed. In the night two sepoys of the 11th
were slightly wounded by random shots. Several
coolies were seen coming through the bazaar from
the direction of the Cawnpore road. Sharp-shooting
all day long from the enemy, who had also got a
new gun in position to the right of Mr. Gubbins's
post. One mine completed, and three others steadily
progressing; the enemy digging on all sides.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 26th.</i>&mdash;The enemy commenced the day
with a very heavy fire of round shot and musketry
a little before daylight, which subsided in a great
measure in about half an hour. Their earthworks
had been added to during the night; but it was
difficult to distinguish new work, as the whole of our
position was now surrounded with them on every
side quite close up to us. A jemadar of the 71st
was shot dead near the Redan this morning by one
of the enemy's riflemen. The house of Innes was
reported to be in a dangerous state, in consequence
of the repeated round shots through it. Also
reports were made of the enemy mining at the
Redan. The enemy unusually quiet, and very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
firing went on during the middle of the day, but
they were busily employed in making trenches
round us in every direction, and worked particularly
hard in front of the Redan, with many coolies. No
intelligence whatever. One or two servants deserted
last night, and there were reports that all the
servants were thinking of leaving us, unless our reinforcements
arrived soon.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 27th.</i>&mdash;A good deal of rain during the
night. A heavy cannonade from the enemy, and the
usual amount of musketry fire all the morning.</p>

<p>To-day, the supplies of the late Brigadier-General
Sir Henry Lawrence, K.C.B., were sold by auction.
The brandy realised from 140 to 160 rupees (16<i>l.</i>)
per dozen; beer averaged from 60 to 70 rupees
(7<i>l.</i>); sherry 70 rupees; hermetically sealed hams
from 70 to 75 rupees (7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>) each; a bottle of
honey 45 rupees (4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>); rifle gunpowder, 16
rupees per lb. (1<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>); small cakes of chocolate,
from 30 to 40 rupees (3<i>l.</i> to 4<i>l.</i>); and other things
in proportion. Sugar (had there been any for sale)
would have commanded almost any price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
The enemy brought another gun into position opposite
the racket court, and where we had no means
of replying to them. A soldier of the 32nd was very
seriously wounded this morning by a musket-ball,
while sitting in the verandah of Dr. Fayrer's house.
In the evening a 3-pounder shot killed a soldier of
the 32nd and carried away the arm of another. A
native officer of the 13th was wounded through the
foot by a musket-ball. Our miners (working in the
gallery we had run out thirty-three feet to the
right of the brigade mess-house) heard the
enemy distinctly mining towards us. Their sap
seemed to run for the centre of the brigade mess.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;Heavy rain nearly all night, which
considerably injured our sap to the right of the
brigade mess, in consequence of it leaking; the rain
ceasing at daylight, we set to work, and in a few
hours got if cleared out, and had our people at work
again. A good deal of fever prevalent, and great
mortality among the children, who faded away
rapidly from want of proper food. A smart cannonade
at daylight from the enemy, who fired heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
with two guns on Mr. Gubbins's house; fortunately
no casualties occurred. Last night, three
men deserted to the enemy from Mr. Gubbins's post.
One, a chuprassee of Mr. G.'s, took with him 400
rupees (40<i>l.</i>) belonging to different people; four
servants belonging to officers also deserted.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonham fired his mortar, equipped as
a howitzer, fourteen times during the day, against the
new battery erected against Mr. Gubbins's post, and
with considerable success, having struck it ten times;
but their battery was of great strength, and required
a good deal more battering to do it much mischief.
We waited with impatience for the enemy's miners
to break through our gallery, and were obliged to
stop our own men, as the enemy left off work immediately
they heard our people's pickaxe.</p>

<p>This night we learnt, by a letter from General
Havelock, dated Cawnpore, the 24th instant, that
we had no hope of being relieved for another
twenty-five days.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 29th.</i>&mdash;Cooler weather. Our miners
busily employed endeavouring to break into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
enemy's gallery, which, though quite close to our
own, had not yet been found. The magazine sergeants
at work, making an expence magazine in the
Begum Kotee. The upper story of Mr. Gubbins's
house was no longer safe, owing to the numbers of
round shot through it, and the ladies were removed.
Much difficulty was experienced in finding
quarters for them, every place being so crowded,
and the ladies were already four and five together
in very small badly ventilated native buildings;
dreadful smells pervading the whole place, from the
half-buried bodies of men, horses, and bullocks, and
also from the drains&mdash;some of which were fearfully
offensive, as we had no means of attending to them.
Several more servants deserted last night; which
caused the very greatest inconvenience, as already
very few officers had any. About 10 <small>A.M.</small> our
miners broke into the enemy's gallery, which they
immediately abandoned, and began to fill in the
shaft; we as instantly applied a barrel of powder at
the farther end of their sap, and blew up their work
altogether. Our men brought away their lantern,
tools, and a bottle of oil, which in their haste they
had left. Very heavy rain all the forenoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
Sickness became daily more prevalent, and a number
of officers and "the uncovenanted" were daily placed
on the sick list. To-day it was decided to issue one
month's pay after the 1st proximo, for the month of
July. The heavy rain caused one of the enemy's
mines, running towards the outpost called Mrs. Sago's
house, to fall in. This mine was never known to
us, or even suspected. Many and grave doubts and
suspicions were entertained that the enemy were
running a mine towards the Redan battery. Captain
Fulton, Garrison Engineer, did not, however,
share in this opinion. A native artilleryman, who
belonged to a number entertained by Mr. Gubbins,
deserted from his post while on sentry over one of
the guns in Mr. G.'s compound. A European sentry
fired at him, but did not succeed in hitting him.</p>

<p>Now that it appeared evident that the siege must
last in all probability another month, increased care
and vigilance in the issuing of all stores was observed.
The rain cleared off towards evening. A
considerable cannonade all through the night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 30th.</i>&mdash;A heavy cannonade all night. Four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
half-castes (Christians) one of whom had been made a
local sergeant, and was head-writer in Captain Weston's
office, deserted to the enemy; having broke
open the door in the barrier they had to defend, and
left the post unprotected. He took with him, in addition
to Captain Boileau's gun, five drummers, formerly
in the king of Oude's service, two drummers
of the 48th, and some ten native servants. An eight-inch
shell burst in the native hospital this morning,
killing one native and wounding two others. An
attack was expected to-day, and everything was prepared
as far as possible to repel it. A good many
cases of fever. Divine service was performed at the
brigade mess at noon, and at Mr. Gubbins's house at
2 <small>P.M.</small>, when the sacrament was administered, and
at Dr. Fayrer's house at half-past 5 <small>P.M.</small> To-day,
Lieut. Bonham, of the artillery, was very severely
wounded by a musket-ball, while sitting in the doorway
of the Post-office: he was a very great loss to
the garrison, having very greatly distinguished himself
throughout the siege; particularly in the accuracy
with which he used his mortars, and the excellent
practice he had made with a mortar which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
had made to act as a howitzer. This was the third
time he had been wounded since hostilities began on
the 30th of June. Very little firing during the middle
of the day, and not much movement observable
among the enemy. A European soldier of the 32nd
died very suddenly to-day; he lost the use of his side
from sleeping in the wet trenches, and died in hospital
a few hours after. Europeans and natives all
greatly distressed on account of the want of tobacco,
of which we have had none left for distribution for
a considerable time past. Great difficulty was experienced
in getting shelter for women and children;
so many houses had been destroyed by the round
shot and shells of the enemy: all suffered greatly
from being crowded together in low, small, badly
ventilated buildings. The dreadful stench which
pervaded that part of the defences held by the
commissariat officers and the uncovenanted service,
exceeded all belief. It arose from the decayed entrails
of the bullocks and sheep daily killed by the
butchers, and of which we had no means of disposing,
but by throwing them over the defences: the decayed
boosah and vegetable matter which here also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
abounded, assisting in creating a stench which was
probably never exceeded. Nearly every officer who
slept at this post was laid up with fever at one time
or another; but as it was one of the weakest parts
of our defences, it was absolutely requisite that two
officers should be ever with the party occupying it.
A false alarm at sunset, and a heavy cannonade
brought the day's proceedings to a close.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;The enemy fired at intervals very
hard, both guns and musketry, particularly towards
daylight. Then we found they had got another very
large gun, apparently a 32-pounder, in position under
the Lutkun Durwaza, and about 100 yards from
the Baillie Guard gates, on which it fired several
times, smashing two ammunition waggons with
which the gates were barricaded. Towards the
middle of the day the enemy were unusually quiet,
confining themselves to sharp-shooting. An excellent
artillery sergeant was killed at Mr. Gubbins's
post, by a rifle-ball, which struck him in the side.</p>

<p>The heat excessive. In the evening, the kitmutghar
of the late Captain Hayes, military secretary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
who had come in some ten days before, and was believed
to be a spy, escaped from the 84th Guard
during the night, and contrived to get clear away.
He had been kept in confinement from the time of
his coming in, and had not been allowed to converse
with any one; and therefore could give little or no
information. About 10 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy very suddenly
opened from nearly all their guns, and threw
in a heavy fire of musketry, which subsided in
about half an hour. All the 13th Native Infantry
employed in making a new sunken battery to the
right of the guard-room, in order to oppose the
battery of the enemy which was located in the
Lutkun Durwaza. Our people in the Redan battery
had a narrow escape from an 8-inch shell,
which just cleared the parapet and exploded outside.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;A fine breezy morning. Not very
much firing; but a great deal of bugling was heard
among the enemy's troops during the early part
of the morning. Rumours that the half-caste Christians
who deserted had been murdered. The enemy's
24-pounder fired several shots during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
morning, which took effect on the gates, smashing
them considerably. The enemy reported to be
running another mine towards the brigade mess.</p>

<p>Our third sap from Anderson's post nearly completed,
and considerable progress made in the one
commenced out of Sago's house. All the boys in
garrison above ten years of age were collected and
set to work with hand-mills, to assist in grinding
flour for the use of the garrison. Sickness showed
itself amongst the bullocks; and in the last two
days two bullocks had to be suddenly killed, in order
to save the meat. This was most unfortunate, as
the stock in hand would not last (even at the
reduced rate of rations) the time we might probably
be besieged. Arrangements were made to have
some artillery and irregular cavalry horses that
were wounded, or from want of condition were
unserviceable, turned out on this evening. The
last cook-boy of the artillery absconded last night.
This put the men to much inconvenience, as they
had now to draw their rations with Her Majesty's
32nd Regiment; but it was better for the service,
as now there was no excuse for any of the guns'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
crews leaving their batteries for their food. This
morning some fresh beef was accidentally removed
from the slaughter-yard in one of the magazine
carts. As these carts were used also for transporting
grain, it excited remark amongst some
Seikhs. The cart in question was immediately
marked in the presence of the Commissariat Establishment,
and strict orders were given that it
should not be used again. This shows how careful
we had to be with all the natives about their castes.</p>

<p>In the evening, about dusk, two European artillerymen
were struck in the Post-office battery by an
18-pounder shot, which killed both. Great progress
was made in the battery which was erected
by the 13th Native Infantry, for the 18-pounder
to be placed in at the Baillie Guard gate. Two
8-inch shells exploded in the vicinity of our magazine,
but without doing any injury. Our third
mine from Anderson's house completed, but not
charged, it being retained as a listening gallery.
Another shaft for a mine was struck out from
Captain Saunders' post, to be ready to meet the
enemy's so soon as it could be ascertained which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
way they were mining. The cook-boys of two
companies of the 32nd Foot deserted to-day, which
caused extreme inconvenience.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>2nd September.</i>&mdash;Sounds of mining heard near
the slaughter-house. This was quite a new direction
for the enemy to commence this work at; but it had
not yet been ascertained for a certainty, and appeared
most unlikely. Last night three men of
Her Majesty's 32nd Regiment died in hospital.</p>

<p>About 9 <small>A.M.</small> this morning a mine of the enemy
was discovered within thirty feet of Captain Saunders'
post: they came up to a well, and, not knowing
what it was, made a hole in the surface; when the
smoke from their lamp became apparent. A countermine
was immediately commenced and run out
sixteen feet, and within two feet of the enemy; it
was quickly loaded and tamped for about fourteen
feet, and the head of their gallery was blown in.
Their miners were heard at work when the hose of
our mine was ignited; and it was believed they
must have sustained some loss. Another of the
enemy's mines was also discovered this morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
coming for the centre of the brigade mess-house;
but we had a shaft and gallery ready to frustrate
their efforts. One of the sepoys of the 13th Regiment
Native Infantry was severely wounded this
morning while standing sentry. We had a heavy
cannonade from the enemy in the afternoon, and
some alteration was made in the position of some of
their guns on the Cawnpore side of our position.
The advance of a month's pay, which had been
offered to all natives, was declined by the 13th,
48th, and 71st, and pensioners, and only four
rupees each was received by the Seikh Cavalry, as
all preferred to receive it in arrears hereafter.
This spoke volumes for their faithfulness.</p>

<p>This evening a very sad event occurred. Lieut.
Birch, of the 59th Regiment Native Infantry, attached
to the Engineer department, went out at
dusk, accompanied by four other officers, to explore
some old ruins quite close to the north side of our
position, in order to see if there were any traces of
mining. The work had been most satisfactorily
performed, and the party were returning, when a
sentry of the 32nd Regiment, who, unfortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
had not received the caution that a party was going
out and to be careful not to fire, seeing objects
moving in the dark outside our limits, fired his
musket; lamentable to relate, it took effect, and
the bullet passed through the lower part of the
belly of Lieutenant Birch, who died two hours
after. He was a gallant and efficient officer, and
had only been married six months. His loss was
greatly deplored by the garrison. Our miners were
all hard at work all day, countermining the enemy,
who still persevered in their efforts to blow us up.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 3rd.</i>&mdash;About 2 <small>A.M.</small> a very heavy
cannonade from the enemy till 9 <small>A.M.</small> Unbarricaded
a door leading out of our position, and turned
loose during the night sixteen horses and a mule,
which had been wounded, and were unfit for use.
Further efforts made to limit the supply of flour,
and issue wheat in lieu thereof. Advances of pay
made to officers, ladies, the civil and uncovenanted
service, and a few natives who desired it.</p>

<p>The sun particularly powerful, and as during the
nights a heavy dew fell, and occasionally the mornings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
were very cool, great fears were entertained for the
health of our men; especially as nearly all had to
sleep in the trenches. Consequently search was
everywhere made for tents to shelter them; but the
majority of these had been used as barricades and
other defences, and were now, from exposure to the
rain, &amp;c., completely rotten and useless.</p>

<p>The enemy commenced mining at Sago's garrison,
and a shaft and gallery were made to meet them. In
the evening there was a heavy cannonade on Mr.
Gubbins's post. A soldier of the 32nd was dangerously
wounded at Innes' house by an 18-pounder
shot, and another slightly wounded by grape shot.
Much heavy firing from the enemy. Very severe
work at mining, as our people were employed at
four different points. After 10 <small>P.M.</small> an exceedingly
heavy cannonade accompanied by musketry. The
enemy were distinctly heard repairing their batteries,
and moving a heavy gun with elephants, in
the direction of the Cawnpore battery.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 4th.</i>&mdash;The usual cannon and musketry
throughout the night, which greatly increased after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
daylight, but gradually subsided after 9 <small>A.M.</small> into a
few solitary discharges of cannon. The outer wall
of the mess house was greatly injured by the constant
firing from the enemy's guns, although it was
of great solidity. Between 9 and 10 <small>A.M.</small> an unusual
commotion was observable in the town, and the
streets were much crowded, for which we were
unable to account; whatever it was, the crowd
gradually dispersed, and by 11 <small>A.M.</small> all was tranquil,
and the enemy's guards were relieved as usual at
that hour.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the day there was very
little firing from the enemy: they could be distinctly
heard in three of our listening galleries, sapping
steadily towards us. A 32nd soldier was severely
contused to-day by a round shot, while on duty in
the Cawnpore battery, and another wounded by a
musket-ball. About 4·30 <small>P.M.</small> Major Bruère, commanding
the 13th Regiment Native Infantry, went
on the top of the brigade mess to endeavour to pick
off some of the enemy's gunners. Unfortunately,
in his anxiety to get a shot at some riflemen, he
somewhat unnecessarily exposed himself, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
hit by a rifle-ball through the chest, which almost
immediately proved fatal. His death was very
greatly lamented by the sepoys of the 13th, with
whom he was very popular: they insisted on carrying
his remains to the grave, and his funeral was
attended by all the men of the 13th who could be
permitted to leave their trenches. The eighteen-pounder
battery made by the sepoys of the 13th,
was now nearly completed, and was sixteen feet
thick, besides the wall in front; the eighteen-pounder
intended for it was got down, and put
in position. The enemy were evidently aware of
what we were about, as two shells fell quite
close; one just inside, and the other outside the
new battery.</p>

<p>The outer wall and buildings on the top of the mess
house fell in this evening, with a great crash, consequent
on the outer wall having been completely
breached; fortunately no one was hurt, and several
ladies and children still clung to the inner rooms for
shelter, preferring the chance of a round shot or
musket-ball to the fetid close atmosphere of an already
overcrowded hovel in the interior of our position;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
which, after all, was perhaps hardly any safer
from the fire of the enemy.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 5th.</i>&mdash;A fine moonlight morning. Soon
after daylight, the enemy commenced the severest
cannonade we had yet had. About 8000 infantry and
about 500 horse were by sunrise seen moving about
round our position, and evidently preparing for an
attack. The garrison were soon&mdash;every man&mdash;on
the alert, and remained patiently under a tremendous
fire of cannon, awaiting the enemy's onset.
They soon opened fire from a new battery of two
guns across the river; and about 10 <small>A.M.</small> exploded
two mines, one (a large one), close to the 18-pounder
battery, and the other, a smaller one, at the brigade-mess
(which we had countermined and were about
to blow up.) Providentially, the enemy had miscalculated
their distance in both instances, and were
just short of our defences, and neither explosion did
us any harm. As soon as the cloud of dust and
smoke had cleared away, they advanced under cover
of a tremendous fire on several points&mdash;particularly
at Mr. Gubbins's post&mdash;where they came on resolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
and planted an enormous ladder against the
bastion to mount it. Several reached the top, but
were so steadily received with musketry and hand
grenades, that none could gain a footing: and after
several leaders had fallen, the rest fell back to the
cover of the neighbouring houses, where they kept
up a tremendous fire. Their loss was very heavy,
as they showed themselves well; particularly in the
garden close to the brigade-mess and Sikh square,
where they fell rapidly to our rifles and muskets.
Long after the action, they could be seen carrying
away their killed and wounded over the bridges.</p>

<p>During the attack we only had one havildar of pensioners
and two sepoys of the 13th killed, and one
soldier of the 32nd wounded (loss of hand), from
round shot. Eight sepoys of the 13th Native Infantry,
assisted by three artillerymen, loaded and
worked the 18-pounder in the 13th battery, and
after three or four rounds succeeded in silencing the
18-pounder opposed to them. The sepoys were
very proud of this battery, which was entirely under
their charge, and constructed solely by them, under
the superintendence of the Engineers. A fearfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
hot-day, and a broiling sun, to which all were exposed
for nearly the entire day. During last night
another shaft, eight feet deep, was sunk by the
officers of the brigade-mess as a listening gallery,
in case the enemy should run a sap in that direction.</p>

<p>In the evening, the enemy seemed disgusted with
their want of success in the morning, and confined
themselves to a few shots now and then from
their batteries. An 18-pounder came right through
the hospital from their new work across the river,
and passed through the whole length of the building,
which was crowded with patients, and very
slightly wounded Lieutenant Charlton and a soldier
of the 32nd, both of whom were lying there
wounded. Passing as it did through the entire
length of such a crowded space, it was perfectly
extraordinary that this ball did not do more harm.</p>

<p>After all attacks, the enemy were most determined
in their efforts to carry off their dead, and generally
contrived to do so at night. To-day, as usual, the
leading men were most of them knocked over, which
greatly discouraged their followers. All reports
from positions which commanded any views of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
enemy retreating, agreed in saying that they
seemed to-day more thoroughly beaten than ever.</p>

<p>Lieutenant James Graham, of the 4th Cavalry,
shot himself through the head this morning with his
revolver, in a fit of temporary insanity: he left a
wife and child.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 6th.</i>&mdash;At 12 o'clock midnight, the
garrison was aroused by a heavy cannonade from all
sides, and much bugling and shouting; but it all
gradually subsided in about half an hour, without
any reply from our side: during it a soldier of the
32nd lost his leg from a round shot. This morning,
the enemy were unusually quiet, and their guns
more silent than it was remembered for a long time.</p>

<p>The rains seemed to have cleared off, and the sun
was most powerful. Our live stock was now fast
diminishing in numbers, and had any disease broke
out amongst them, it would have been a most
serious loss. Our stock of rum and porter was also
fast running very low. Now that the stagnant
water was fast drying up, the miasmatic stenches in
various parts of the garrison were of a morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
almost insupportable; and it was greatly feared
would produce much fever and other illness. About
1 <small>P.M.</small>, the Engineers made a small sortie from Innes'
post, and blew down a house which yesterday the
enemy commenced to loophole; and which, had they
succeeded in doing, would have been a most serious
matter to Innes' garrison, in the present shattered
and dilapidated state of the house they occupy,
caused by the effects of round shot, which had
steadily for the last month been fired into it from
guns of heavy calibre. Captain Fulton of the
Engineers was slightly contused by an explosion
to-day. About 10 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy sent two men
with loads of combustibles, to place under the
entrance gates, to set fire to them; they were seen,
and one was shot dead by the sentry, on which the
other fled. An hour later, they made a very smart
attack on the Baillie Guard gate, but were quickly
driven back: during this affair, a very excellent
native officer (a subadar), of the 13th Regiment
Native Infantry, was killed in the 13th battery.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 7th.</i>&mdash;The enemy were unusually quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
with their cannon this morning, contenting themselves
with mining, while we as busily endeavoured
to countermine them. An unusual commotion among
them: large numbers crossing and re-crossing the
bridge of boats; and about 11 <small>A.M.</small> a regiment, with
colours, and band playing, and about 1000 matchlockmen,
passed from right to left of our position.
About 5000 men passed during the afternoon from
right to left; many of them seemed as though they
had marched in from a distance. Heavy showers
during the afternoon; the garrison constantly wet.</p>

<p>Our miners, both European and native, were
greatly done up with their day and night exertions,
which were absolutely requisite for our preservation.
In all these operations the Seikhs and Hindoostanee
sepoys worked remarkably well.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 8th.</i>&mdash;Captain Simons of the Artillery,
who had been long suffering from his wounds, died
early this morning. A tolerable cannonade kept up
all night. The enemy had now completed a breach
in the wall enclosing the courtyard of the Martiniere
School, broad enough for four or five men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
to pass through abreast, and which we were obliged
to retrench and stockade. Nearly one-half of the
officers were on the sick list, with fever and dysentery.</p>

<p>The shot fired in by the enemy were yesterday
collected, and 280 round shot, varying in size
from a 24 to a 3-pounder, were gathered from the
roof of the brigade-mess alone! In the evening we
had heavy rain and a moderate cannonade.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 9th.</i>&mdash;During the night a shell exploded
in a room occupied by a lady and some children,
and though almost every article in the room was
destroyed, yet all providentially escaped.</p>

<p>Finding this morning that the enemy were rapidly
mining towards the Cawnpore battery, it was deemed
advisable that our mine, containing 200 lbs. of powder,
which had been ready and charged for upwards of a
month, should be exploded; and accordingly, at
10 <small>A.M.</small>, it was sprung. The effect was tremendous,
and it evidently astonished the enemy, whose miners
must have been destroyed. They immediately beat
to arms, and opened on us from most of their batteries
on that side of our position. When the smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
and dust (which were tremendous) had blown away,
it was seen that the explosion had destroyed all the
front face of the outhouses opposite our battery.</p>

<p>In the evening a body of 3000 men moved up to
our right flank, which caused us all to keep particularly
on the alert. About 11 <small>P.M.</small> very heavy rain
began to fall, and the early part of the night passed
away quietly. For the third time since the siege
commenced there was no funeral on this day.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 10th.</i>&mdash;The rain cleared away towards
morning, and all was moderately quiet till 6 <small>A.M.</small>,
from which hour till 10 <small>A.M.</small> an unusually heavy
cannonade was kept up, and replied to by our guns
and mortars. All the state jewels were brought
over from the Residency, and put into the Begum
Kotee for better security.</p>

<p>Owing to the necessity for blowing up the Muchee
Bhawun, the officers brought in with them nothing
but the clothes they wore. Many others in this
garrison had lost everything when their bungalows
in cantonments were burnt; and a few better off
had shared their wardrobes with them. As time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
went on, however, clothes wore out, and there were
no means of providing others; and by this time
officers might have been seen wearing the most
extraordinary costumes; few, if any, had any
semblance of a military uniform, and very many were
in shirts, trowsers, and slippers only; one gallant
civilian having found an old billiard-table cloth, had
contrived to make himself a kind of loose coat out
of it, while an officer wore a shirt made out of a
floor cloth. All carried muskets, and were accoutred
like the soldiers. At the auction of the effects of an
officer recently killed, a single bottle of brandy
realised seventeen rupees (thirty-four shillings).
The soldiers had for a month past all been out of
tobacco, and had taken to smoking dried tea and
common leaves. Not very much firing in the
evening.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 11th.</i>&mdash;This was a quieter night than
usual with the garrison. Much disturbance was
heard among the enemy, and the noise of elephants
was distinctly heard, as if they were moving some of
their guns into other positions. About sunrise, two
sides of Innes' house, which had been steadily cannonaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
daily with 18-pounder shot, fell in, and the
two sentries on that side escaped with difficulty;
the post was, however, still nobly held, and preparation
made for making some kind of a defence out of
the debris. Many bodies of armed men were seen
moving about, and we had the usual three hours'
morning cannonade. About 10 <small>A.M.</small>, as our mine
out of the Seikh square (which had been charged
with 200 lbs. of powder) was ready, it was determined
to explode it, as the enemy's miners could be
very distinctly heard sapping quite close; it was
very successful, completely destroying all their
excavations, and buried the party who were at work,
the groans and moans of some of whom were heard
for some time after. Later in the day, another
mine of the enemy was discovered in the churchyard.
A sortie was made under Captain Fulton
of the Engineers (the ground being open), and the
working party were driven off and their work
examined. It proved to be shaft and gallery, fully
five feet high, and extended twenty-four feet, running
in a straight line to the church: two barrels of
powder were separately exploded in it, and completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
destroyed the entire work. Two of the
enemy were shot by Lieutenant Sewell this afternoon.</p>

<p>At dusk, the enemy threw in (apparently from
a howitzer) five hollow iron cylinders, filled with
a composition (similar to that with which we are
accustomed to fill our carcases) done up in strong
canvas. On reaching the ground, the apparatus
burst, and the five cylinders spouted forth fire without
any further explosion: this, perhaps, was the most
curious and complicated projectile that had yet been
received by the garrison. At 7 <small>P.M.</small> very heavy
rain, which lasted an hour and a half.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 12th.</i>&mdash;A tremendous row and noise in
the city all night. A shaft sunk in the centre of the
brigade-mess, in view to running a sap out across the
road into the garden, in front of the enemy's battery.
Rather less firing all day than usual. Very large
bodies of matchlockmen were seen moving about, but
a smaller proportion of sepoys. A soldier of the
32nd and an uncovenanted man were wounded; the
former in the head, the latter through the hand.
During the past few days no case of cholera occurred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
In the evening after dark, the 71st sepoys were employed
under Lieutenant Langmore in bringing in
some tents which were piled up in the Residency
garden; while so employed, one of the enemy came up,
evidently having mistaken our party for one of his
own. He was immediately seized by two sepoys and
brought in. An European sentry was killed to-day
through a small loophole in the Redan, out of which
he was looking, and another in the same battery was
wounded during the night.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 12th.</i>&mdash;A smart cannonade at daylight.
Considerable progress was made in our new mines
out of the Cawnpore battery and brigade-mess.
Captain Mansfield was seized with cholera early this
morning, and died a few hours after. A great
number of matchlockmen seen moving about in the
bazaar. Enormous prices offered in the garrison for
all kinds of supplies. A small fowl was to-day
purchased by a gentleman for his sick wife for 20
rupees (2<i>l.</i>) A bottle of Curaçoa sold at auction a
day or two ago for 16 rupees, and the same price
was freely offered for two pounds of sugar. Divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
service performed at the brigade-mess, and at Dr.
Fayrer's to all who were able to attend. A man
came in about 8 <small>P.M.</small> from the city. He could not
or would not give any information, was looked upon
as a spy, ironed and placed in the main-guard. A
tolerably quiet evening.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 14th.</i>&mdash;A good many matchlockmen
were seen coming into the town during the day,
both over the stone bridge and the bridge of boats.
For the last two days, the bugles of the enemy had
not been heard, which led us to conclude that the
head-quarters of regiments had probably left the city.
A few doolies were seen passing down the Cawnpore
road, and a man (apparently of some consequence) was
observed haranguing a mob in the city. There was
the usual amount of firing and sharp-shooting all day.</p>

<p>A grievous occurrence took place in the afternoon.
Captain Fulton of the Engineers, while reconnoitring
from a battery in Mr. Gubbins's post, was
killed dead by a round shot, which struck him on the
head. He had conducted all the engineering operations
of the siege for a considerable time previous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
the death of his chief (Major Anderson). He was a
highly gifted, cool, brave, and chivalrous officer,
fertile in resources, and a favourite with both officers
and men. His loss was acutely felt.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 15th.</i>&mdash;The 18-pounder battery beyond
Innes' house fired heavily, and reduced Innes'
house to almost a heap of ruins; the shot came right
across the entire open space round the Residency,
and one soldier of the 32nd was mortally and
another slightly wounded. The breach in the
Seikh square made by the enemy was now tolerably
retrenched. The inner square was well loopholed
and barricaded, so that even if the enemy had
made their way in, they would have been unable to
make a lodgment. The vicinity of the houses to
our defences in the outer square rendered mining
easy, and we took and blew up three of the enemy's
mines at this point alone. Lieutenant Fullerton of
the 16th Regiment Native Infantry, died in hospital
this morning.</p>

<p>To-day the verandah of the Residency fell in
with a great crash, from the effects of the battering it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
had received from the enemy's 18-pound shot. This
afternoon, a mortar, equipped as a howitzer (on
Lieutenant Bonham's principle), was put in position
against the 18-pounder battery opposite Innes'
house, and fired several shots, which kept the
enemy's gun in check; and one shell having blown
away most of their parapet, they did not fire again
from it during the evening. Under the direction of
the garrison engineer, a shaft was commenced in
the Baillie Guard gate by the sepoys of 13th Regiment
Native Infantry, in order to run a sap out in
the direction of the Lutkun Durwaza; eight feet
and a half were this evening accomplished. It is intended
as a safeguard, to cut off any mine that the
enemy may be running towards the gateway.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 16th.</i>&mdash;A very sharp cannonade from
daylight, for three hours. An 8-inch shell fell in the
rear of the 13th battery, (for the second time
since the commencement of hostilities) and mortally
wounded a sepoy, and slightly wounded a subadar.
Enemy were very busy erecting (apparently) a new
battery, to the right of our Cawnpore battery; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
it was difficult at the time to say what it was intended
for: the people working at it were greatly
annoyed by our shells, and it made but little progress,
except during the night. They were also
very hard at work in front of the Redan battery,
where they had made deep trenches in all directions.</p>

<p>Ungud, pensioner and spy, was sent out at about
10 <small>P.M.</small> with a letter, done up in a piece of quill, to
take to General Havelock at Cawnpore, and was
promised a large reward if he brought a reply.
Preparations made for getting the mortar howitzer
into the courtyard in rear of the brigade-mess, by
cutting a road through the intermediate walls. The
mine out of the brigade-mess building, and that out
of the Cawnpore battery, were worked all night, and
considerable progress was made in both. The rains
seemed quite over, the sun was very powerful, and
much fever prevailed. Not so much firing as usual
in the evening, and only one shell came in. Much
bugling among the enemy during the night.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 17th.</i>&mdash;All very much as usual, with
rather less firing. Many vague rumours were abroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
in the garrison, all without foundation. The mortar
howitzer was got into position behind the brigade
mess; the second shell thrown from it severely
wounded two of our servants, in consequence of the
shell having exploded before it cleared our defences.
After the range was, however, once got, the practice
was good, and several shells exploded in the embrasure
of the enemy's battery. The mine out of
the brigade-mess and that out of the Cawnpore
battery, damaged during the day by round shot, was
also repaired by a working party of sepoys from the
48th regiment Native Infantry. The sentry of the
32nd Foot, on duty at the church, had his head
carried off by a round shot. Exactly at midnight
the enemy made a demonstration on Saunders's post,
and fired heavy volleys of musketry, but made no
attempt to advance; in about half an hour, after a
few shells had been thrown among them, they retired.</p>

<p>Many cases of fever and dysentery. Two sepoys
of the 13th died in hospital of their wounds.
The Seikh cavalry sowars, under Lieutenant Hardinge,
worked at the barricade across the breach in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
the third Seikh square, and still further strengthened
it.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 18th.</i>&mdash;Nothing new to record. Each
day passed away much like its predecessor, with the
same amount of cannonading and musketry fire.</p>

<p>Throughout the siege, a regular system of look-out
was organised from the top of the tower in the
Residency, which commanded a view of the river,
the three bridges, and the open country beyond;
and also from the roof of the Post-office, from which
a great part of the city and the road to Cawnpore
could be observed. At the former post the officers
were relieved every two hours, and at the latter
hourly. At each post a book was kept, in which
whatever had been observed was noted down, and
if anything unusual, or any new work of the enemy
was seen, a report of it was instantly forwarded for
Brigadier Inglis's information. A new truck was
constructed to enable us to fit out another mortar as
a howitzer, for it would be impossible to say how
greatly we felt throughout the siege the want of
a couple of 8-inch howitzers. To-day, the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
threw in (evidently from a 13-inch mortar) a piece
of wood of very great weight, which measured twelve
inches in diameter and eighteen in length! It made
a prodigious noise as it passed through the air.</p>

<p>In consequence of the very small stock of rum left
in store, all the Europeans were reduced to one dram
each per day. This was perhaps the quietest day of
the siege up to this date, as we had nothing but a
few stray cannon shots and a slight musketry fire
throughout the twenty-four hours. About 11 <small>P.M.</small>
a very considerable noise was heard in the town,
together with much bugling and shouting.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 19th.</i>&mdash;This morning, almost before
daylight, we commenced a heavy cannonade from
the Post-office on the battery in the square house
opposite. During the morning the enemy kept up
also a heavy fire all around; particularly on the
Residency, which now wore a most desolate tumbledown
and dilapidated appearance, from the effect of
round shot which had been steadily poured into it
daily from the commencement of the siege. About
10·30 <small>A.M.</small> the enemy's battery in the square house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
opposite the Post-office was set on fire by our shot,
and a pretty sharp fusillade and cannonade was kept
up by us to prevent the enemy from distinguishing
it; the fire however soon died out. An auction
was held this day in the Residency of the property
(clothes, &amp;c.) of deceased officers, and the prices
that all useful articles fetched was enormous: for
instance, a new flannel shirt was knocked down for
forty rupees, while five old ones were sold for 112
rupees, and a bottle of brandy brought twenty
rupees. A man of the 84th was shot dead at Sago's
post early this morning. During the day the enemy
threw into our position, probably from an enormous
mortar, six pieces of wood about the size and shape
of a large oyster barrel; they were thrown up in
the air to an enormous height, and came down with
almost incredible force.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 20th.</i>&mdash;At 1 <small>A.M.</small> a smart musketry
fire and cannonade took place, which lasted for
about half an hour. At daylight discovered two
new batteries, which the enemy had very nearly
completed, and one of which contained a 32-pounder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
We opened on them with a howitzer
and an 18-pounder, but did them little mischief;
the batteries having been made excessively strong,
with enormous beams of wood and earth. We
however, entirely prevented them from working at
either battery during the ensuing night. The
Cawnpore battery was repaired, and the centre
mine from the brigade mess was connected with the
one we had previously run out from the left. The
guard-room at Anderson's house was lowered by
digging out the floor, so as to keep the guard clear
of the round shot which passed through it; the
13th mine was also worked eighteen feet further.
A very considerable noise was heard in the city for
some hours after dark. During the day nearly as
many men as usual seen moving about. A private
of Her Majesty's 32nd at Innes' post was killed by
a round shot.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 21st.</i>&mdash;Between 12 and 1 o'clock <small>A.M.</small>
the enemy suddenly began a very smart musketry
fire all along the city side of our position, and opened
from their guns. We threw a few shells amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
them; and their fire soon subsided into the usual
steady fire which had gone on every night of the siege.</p>

<p>About 4 <small>A.M.</small>, we had very heavy rain which
lasted till about 11 <small>A.M.</small> The heavy rain seemed to
keep the enemy quiet, and there was little firing
on either side till 1 <small>P.M.</small>, when one of our 18-pounders
at the Post-office opened on the enemy's
new 32-pounder battery, and knocked their parapet
about, leaving the gun greatly exposed; which
enabled Captain Saunders's garrison to pick off two
of the enemy's gunners at the gun, and keep it silent
for the rest of the day. In the afternoon, the
enemy battered down a great portion of the wall
enclosing the building occupied by the Martiniere
school-boys, and killed a water-carrier who was
drawing water at the time, and who was knocked
dead into the well; which was a great misfortune,
as none of the natives would again use it. The
body was got up soon after. Not many armed men
were seen in the morning beyond the enemy's
regular relief of guards and pickets. At 10 <small>P.M.</small>
heavy rain came on. About 11 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy
were reported to be in unusual strength near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
Seikh square, on which all were kept well on the
alert. A shell was thrown among them, but nothing
further took place.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;Continued heavy rain, which fell
without cessation till about 3 <small>P.M.</small> The garrison
were in a great state of discomfort, as little shelter
was to be had anywhere; the roofs of all the
buildings were so injured from eighty-four days'
constant cannonading that but few could boast of a
waterproof residence. Lieutenant Cunliffe of the
Artillery, died early this morning from fever; he had
previously been wounded. A Seikh sepoy of the
13th, a native artilleryman, two private servants,
and three grass-cutters deserted during the night;
and in the course of the morning four cook boys contrived
to desert during the heavy rain. The rain did
considerable damage to various parts of our defences,
washing down many of the fascines in the batteries,
and causing several parts of the defences at Mr.
Gubbins's and Innes' post to fall down. A great part
of the outside wall of the brigade mess also fell from
the same cause. Towards evening the enemy opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
their guns, and we dismounted one of their 9-pounders
by a shell, which fell on the top of one of them
and killed two gunners. About 11 <small>P.M.</small> Ungud,
pensioner, returned, bringing us a letter containing
the glad tidings that our relieving force, under
General Outram, had crossed the Ganges, and would
arrive in a few days. His arrival, and the cheering
news he brought of speedy aid, was well-timed; for
neither our fast diminishing stores, the vague and
uncertain rumours of the advent of reinforcements,
nor the daily sights and sounds by which we were
surrounded, were calculated to inspire confidence and
check desertion among the servants and camp followers.
All the garrison were greatly elated with
the news, and on many of the sick and wounded, the
speedy prospect of a change of air and security
exercised a most beneficial effect. Heavy rain fell
about 11 <small>P.M.</small></p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 23rd.</i>&mdash;About 3 <small>A.M.</small> the rain cleared
off, and at 11 <small>A.M.</small> the sun came out and the clouds
dispersed, and gave promise of fair weather. A
smart cannonade was heard in the direction of Cawnpore;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
several imagined they also heard musketry,
and the sound was listened to with the most intense
and even painful anxiety by the garrison, who felt
assured it must be their friends advancing to their
assistance. But it was hardly expected that our force
could have advanced so far, owing to the heavy rain
which had fallen, and the state in consequence that
the roads and country were in; however at 5 <small>P.M.</small>
another distant cannonade was heard which lasted for
half an hour, and which appeared much nearer than
before: this elicited many and divers opinions, and
created the greatest possible excitement.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, large bodies of troops with
guns and ammunition waggons were seen moving
about in the city, in the early part of the day to the
right, and later, in large bodies to the left. In the
afternoon, the enemy placed a gun in position facing
down the Kass bazaar street, with what object it
was impossible to say. We threw many shells into
the city during the day among the parties of the
enemy seen moving about. At 9 <small>P.M.</small> heavy rain
began and fell for two hours.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
<i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;Everything most unusually
quiet throughout the night, and only one or two
cannon shot were fired early in the morning. A
considerable body of cavalry were seen moving to the
right through the city, and about 8·30 <small>A.M.</small> a distant
cannonade was heard, which continued nearly all day.</p>

<p>We had no news of any kind, and the anxiety
of the garrison was very great. During the morning,
large bodies of the enemy were seen moving
through the city to the right and left. Ensign
Hewitt, of the 41st Regiment Native Infantry, was
slightly contused on the head by bricks struck out of
a wall by a round shot. At 8 <small>P.M.</small> the enemy made
a false attack on the Cawnpore battery, keeping up
a heavy cannonade and musketry fire which lasted
for about half an hour, after which all became moderately
quiet. During the night guns were heard in
the direction of the Cawnpore road, and the flash of
them could be very distinctly seen; they were supposed
to be about seven miles distant.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p class="gap-above"><i>September 25th.</i>&mdash;A very unquiet night. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
alarms, one at 1·30 <small>A.M.</small> and another at 4 <small>A.M.</small>
The whole garrison were under arms nearly the
whole night. A very great disturbance in the
city, in the direction of Mr. Gubbins's post especially.
To the very great regret of the garrison,
Captain Radcliffe of the 7th Light Cavalry was
dangerously wounded while in command of the
Cawnpore battery. About 10 <small>A.M.</small> a messenger
came in bringing in a letter of the 16th instant
from General Outram, dated Cawnpore, announcing
his being about to cross over to this side of
the Ganges, and march on to Lucknow. The
messenger could give no account of our force,
beyond its having reached the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>About 11 <small>A.M.</small> nearly all sound of firing had
ceased, but increased agitation was visible among
the people in the town, in which two large fires
were seen. An hour later, the sound of musketry
and the smoke of guns was distinctly perceived
within the limits of the city. All the garrison was
on the alert, and the excitement amongst many of
the officers and soldiers was quite painful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
witness. At 1·30 <small>P.M.</small> many of the people of the
city commenced leaving, with bundles of clothes, &amp;c.
on their heads, and took the direction of cantonments
across the different bridges. At 2 <small>P.M.</small>
armed men and sepoys commenced to follow them,
accompanied by large bodies of Irregular Cavalry.
Every gun and mortar that could be brought to
bear on the evidently retreating enemy, was fired
as fast as possible, for at least an hour and a half.
The enemy's bridge of boats had evidently been
destroyed and broken away, for many were seen
swimming across the river, most of them cavalry
with their horses' bridles in their hands. Strange to
relate, during all this apparent panic, the guns of
the enemy in position all round us kept up a heavy
cannonade, and the matchlockmen or riflemen never
ceased firing from their respective loopholes.</p>

<p>At 4 <small>P.M.</small> report was made that some officers
dressed in shooting coats and solah caps, a regiment
of Europeans in blue pantaloons and shirts, and a
bullock battery were seen near Mr. Martin's house
and the Motee Muhal. At 5 <small>P.M.</small> volleys of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
musketry, rapidly growing louder, were heard in the
city. But soon the firing of a minié ball over our
heads gave notice of the still nearer approach of our
friends; of whom as yet little or nothing had been
seen, though the enemy were to be seen firing
heavily on them from many of the roofs of the
houses. Five minutes later, and our troops were
seen fighting their way through one of the principal
streets; and though men fell at almost every step,
yet nothing could withstand the headlong gallantry
of our reinforcements. Once fairly <span class="smcap">SEEN</span>, all our
doubts and fears regarding; them were ended: and
then the garrison's long pent-up feelings of
anxiety and suspense burst forth in a succession
of deafening cheers; from every pit, trench and
battery&mdash;from behind the sandbags piled on shattered
houses&mdash;from every post still held by a few
gallant spirits, rose cheer on cheer&mdash;even from
the hospital! Many of the wounded crawled forth
to join in that glad shout of welcome to those who
had so bravely come to our assistance. It was a
moment never to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
Soon all the rear-guard and heavy guns were
inside our position; and then ensued a scene which
baffles description. For eighty-seven days the
Lucknow garrison had lived in utter ignorance of
all that had taken place outside. Wives who had
long mourned their husbands as dead, were again
restored to them; others, fondly looking forward to
glad meetings with those near and dear to them,
now for the first time learnt that they were alone.
On all sides eager inquiries for relations and friends
were made. Alas! in too many instances the
answer was a painful one.</p>

<p>The force under the command of General Sir
James Outram, G.C.B., came to our assistance at
a heavy sacrifice to themselves. Of 2600 who left
Cawnpore, nearly one-third was either killed or
wounded in forcing their way through the city:
indeed, the losses were so heavy that they could
effect nothing towards our relief; as the enemy were
in overpowering force, and the position having been
extended, in order to accommodate as far as possible
our great increase in numbers, and the guns that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
were in our vicinity having been captured at considerable
loss to ourselves, we remained on three-quarter
rations, as closely besieged as before, until
the 22nd November; when the garrison were finally
relieved by the army under the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>No. I.<br />
<span class="smcap">Captain Radcliffe's</span> (7th Light Cavalry) <span class="smcap">Narrative</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of the 30th May, about 9 o'clock, shots
were heard at Moodkeepore (the cavalry station), in
the direction of the infantry lines in Lucknow. The
7th Cavalry, consisting of about 150 sabres, immediately
were turned out by their officers, and placed in three
troops. On wheeling into line, about 30 men rushed
out of the ranks, and rode furiously towards cantonments:
they were not seen again. The corps advanced
towards the race-course, towards the Residency, at a
canter, which place they reached about half-past 9 or a
quarter to 10. The regiment received orders to patrol
round the Residency, and in the rear of Colonel Halford's
house, which was done accordingly, and they afterwards
formed up in rear of the lines stationed on the city road.</p>

<p>About 11 o'clock the 7th Cavalry marched down to
the Baillie Guard, patrolled towards Muchee Bhawun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
and, finding all safe, returned <i>viâ</i> the stone bridge
through Mukka Gunge, warned all on duty at the
elephant sheds to be on the alert, and reached the Residency
in cantonments about 2 in the morning. At 3
o'clock the 4th troop arrived from Chinahut, under the
command of Captain T. Boileau. At a quarter after gunfire
the cavalry marched off with the two artillery guns from
the Residency, and took up a position on the right of the
line on the 32nd parade ground. The 7th were directed
to move towards Moodkeepore, which place was reported
to have fallen into the hands of the mutineers. The
corps advanced at a canter, and on reaching the plain
close to the race-course, a large body of armed infantry,
amounting to some 1000 men, were seen advancing in
skirmishing order towards the cavalry. The report was,
as regarded Moodkeepore, too true, for the Standard
Guard was looted, public and private property destroyed,
and the 2nd Squadron standard was actually seized from
the hands of the jemadar in charge, and dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Raleigh, who had lately joined the corps,
was brutally murdered at 5 <small>A.M.</small> in front of the first
troop lines. This officer was sick, and unable to join
the regiment the night before when ordered out. The
officer commanding ordered his men to form line to the
front, which was done rather sullenly; but on his ordering
the line to take ground to the right, a number of
men broke out from the ranks, crying out that they
<i>would</i> charge, as their children, etc., were being murdered;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
they rode away towards the mutineers, having
been beckoned to come over by a leader riding a horse
and bearing a standard. Some thirty-five or forty men
left their officers. At this time an officer was sent back
towards cantonments to request Sir Henry Lawrence to
send up some guns, as the small body of cavalry that
were left alone in front of the insurgents were in danger
of being driven back.</p>

<p>The guns soon afterwards came up, and after a few
rounds dispersed the enemy. The 7th Cavalry, in
concert with the Irregulars, followed up the retreating
mutineers, killed one or two, and sent in some ten or
twelve prisoners. The corps returned to Moodkeepore
about 10 o'clock, and marched into cantonments in the
evening, and took up a position on the right of the
line. Some 105 men remained with their officers up to
the 12th June, on which date, by authority, they were
given two months' pay, and allowed a furlough to their
homes till the 15th October. The men remaining after
the mutiny behaved admirably in quarters, and when
told they were to go to their homes obeyed the order,
quietly lodging their arms, and moving quietly homewards.
The horses of the corps were marched down to
the Residency at noon of the 12th, and in the evening
the European and native officers, with the standards,
repaired to the Baillie Guard, opposite to which the
cavalry horses were ordered to be picketed.</p>

<h3>No. II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Account of the Explosion at the Seikh Square on 18th of August.</span></h3>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">(Dated) Lucknow, 19th August, 1857.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> morning, between the hours of 5 and 6, the
enemy sprung a mine at the Seikh Square, blowing down
the corner house, on the top of which Lieutenant Mecham
and Captain Orr, with two sentries, were on the look out
from the loopholes, Lieutenant Soppitt being below at
the time.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the explosion not a single
individual was to be seen in the quarter occupied by the
enemy. Suddenly, however, one man was discovered
by a sentry, and Lieutenant Mecham fired at him, but
missed; and immediately after the mine exploded, sending
four of us, viz., Lieutenant Mecham, Band-sergeant
Curtain, of the 41st Native Infantry, Drummer Ford, of
the 13th Native Infantry, and Captain Orr up in the air,
and burying underneath the ruins of the battery six
drummers and one sepoy, <i>i. e.</i>, Wiltshire, Williams, 13th
Native Infantry, E. Curtain, A. Nugent, Rowlan, 41st
Native Infantry, Fife-major Shipley, 4th Oude Irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
Force, and sepoy Heerah Sing, 48th Regiment Native
Infantry. Of the former, I regret to state that Band-sergeant
Curtain was thrown on the enemy's side and
killed; Lieutenant Mecham and Drummer Ford were
almost unhurt, and Captain Orr escaped with a few
bruises.</p>

<p>Every precaution had been taken by Lieutenants Mecham,
Soppitt, and Captain Orr to guard against all contingencies,
Lieutenant Mecham remaining at night with
the sentries, Lieutenant Soppitt and Captain Orr being
below with the guard, and occasionally visiting the sentries.
Since on duty at the Seikh Battery we had already
discovered two mines, one of which we countermined,
and the other we found to be an abortive attempt at
one. The above discoveries had the effect of making us
doubly vigilant on this point.</p>

<p>The new mine, which occasioned the calamity of
yesterday, must have been worked by the enemy with
sharp and noiseless tools; as&mdash;though a shaft was already
sunk beneath the battery, over which a sentry was
posted, and into which, during our respective tour of
duty, we each occasionally descended for the purpose of
listening whether mining was carried on by the enemy&mdash;not
the slightest sound which in any way led us to
suppose the same was the case, ever reached us.</p>

<p>There was never perfect silence in the square, owing
to the Seikhs' horses being picketed therein, the tramping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
of whose feet on the ground had more than once
previously deceived us.</p>

<p>The smoke and dust thrown up enveloping us for some
moments in complete darkness, and the sudden shock of
the explosion, prevented my personally knowing what
subsequently happened.</p>

<h3>No. III.<br />
<span class="smcap">Division Orders by Major-General Sir J. Outram, G.C.B.</span></h3>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Head Quarters, Lucknow, 5th October, 1857.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> incessant and arduous duties which have devolved
on Brigadier Inglis and his staff, since the arrival of the
relieving force, had hitherto prevented him from furnishing
to the Major-General Commanding the usual official
documents relative to the siege of the garrison.</p>

<p>In the absence of these the Major-General could not,
with propriety, have indulged in any public declaration
of the admiration with which he regards the heroism displayed
by Brigadier Inglis and the glorious garrison he
has so ably commanded during the last three months, and
he has been reluctantly obliged therefore to defer so long
the expression of the sentiments he was desirous to offer.</p>

<p>But the Major-General having at length received Brigadier
Inglis's reports, is relieved from the necessity of
further silence, and he hastens to tender to the Brigadier,
and to every individual member of the garrison, the
assurance of his confidence that their services will be
regarded by the Government under which they are immediately
serving, by the British nation, and by Her
Gracious Majesty, with equal admiration to that with
which he is himself impressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
The Major-General believes that the annals of warfare
contain no brighter page than that which will record
the bravery, fortitude, vigilance, and patient endurance
of hardships, privation, and fatigue, displayed by the
garrison of Lucknow; and he is very conscious that his
unskilled pen must needs fail adequately to convey to the
Right Honourable the Governor-General of India, and
his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, the profound
sense of the merits of that garrison which has been forced
on his mind by a careful consideration of the almost incredible
difficulties with which they have had to contend.</p>

<p>The term "illustrious" was well and happily applied
by a former Governor-General of India to the garrison
of Jellalabad; but some far more laudatory epithet&mdash;if
such the English language contains&mdash;is due, the Major-General
considers, to the brave men whom Brigadier
Inglis has commanded with undeviating success and
untarnished honour through the late memorable siege.
For while the devoted band of heroes who so nobly
maintained the honour of their country's arms under Sir
R. Sale were seldom exposed to actual attack, the Lucknow
garrison, of inferior strength, have, in addition to a
series of fierce assaults, gallantly and successfully repulsed,
been for three months exposed to a nearly incessant
fire from strong and commanding positions, held by
an enemy of overwhelming force, possessing powerful artillery,
having at their command the whole resources of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
what was but recently a kingdom, and animated by an
insane and bloodthirsty fanaticism.</p>

<p>It is a source of heartfelt satisfaction to the Major-General
to be able, to a certain extent, to confer on the
native portion of the garrison an instalment of those
rewards which their gallant and grateful commander has
sought for them, and which he is very certain the Governor-General
will bestow in full; and though the
Major-General, as regards the European portion of the
garrison, cannot do more than give his most earnest and
hearty support to the recommendations of the Brigadier,
he feels assured that the Governor-General of India will
fully and publicly manifest his appreciation of their distinguished
services, and that our beloved Sovereign will
herself deign to convey to them some gracious expression
of royal approbation of their conduct.</p>

<p>Brigadier Inglis has borne generous testimony to the
bravery, vigilance, devotedness, and good conduct of all
ranks; and to all ranks, as the local representative of the
British Indian Government, the Major-General tenders
his warmest acknowledgments,&mdash;he would fain offer his
special congratulations and thanks to the European and
Eurasian portion of the garrison whom Brigadier Inglis
has particularly noticed, but, by doing so, he would forestall
the Governor-General in the exercise of what, the
Major-General is assured, will be one of the most pleasing
acts of his official life.</p>

<h3>No. IV.<br />
<span class="smcap">From Brigadier Inglis, Commanding Garrison of Lucknow, to the Secretary to Government Military Department, Calcutta.</span></h3>

<div class="top">
<div class="small right1">Lucknow, September 26th, 1857.</div>
<div class="left1"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</div>
</div>

<p class="ind"><span class="smcap">In</span> consequence
of the very deeply-to-be-lamented
death of Brigadier-General Sir H. M. Lawrence, K.C.B.,
late in command of the Oude Field Force, the duty of
narrating the military events which have occurred at
Lucknow since the 29th of June last has devolved upon
myself.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day several reports reached
Sir Henry Lawrence that the rebel army, in no very
considerable force, would march from Chinhut (a small
village about eight miles distant, on the road to Fyzabad)
on Lucknow on the following morning; and the
late Brigadier-General therefore determined to make a
strong reconnaissance in that direction, with the view, if
possible, of meeting the force at a disadvantage, either
at its entrance into the suburbs of the city, or at the
bridge across the Gokral, which is a small stream intersecting
Fyzabad road, midway between Lucknow and
Chinhut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
The force destined for this service, and which was
composed as follows, moved out at 6 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning
of the 30th of June:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Artillery.</i>&mdash;Four guns of No. &mdash; Horse Light Field
Battery, four guns of No. 2 Oude Field Battery, two
guns of No. 3 Oude Field Battery, and an 8-inch
howitzer.</p>

<p><i>Cavalry.</i>&mdash;Troop of Volunteer Cavalry, and 120
troopers of detachments belonging to the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd Regiments of Oude Irregular Cavalry.</p>

<p><i>Infantry.</i>&mdash;Three hundred of Her Majesty's 32nd,
150 of the 13th Native Infantry, 60 of the 48th Native
Infantry, and 20 of the 71st Native Infantry (Sikhs).</p>

<p>The troops, misled by the reports of wayfarers&mdash;who
stated that there were few or no men between Lucknow
and Chinhut&mdash;proceeded somewhat farther than had
been originally intended, and suddenly fell in with the
enemy, who had up to that time eluded the vigilance of
the advanced guard, by concealing themselves behind a
long line of trees in overwhelming numbers. The European
force and the howitzer, with the native infantry,
held the foe in check for some time, and had the six
guns of the Oude Artillery been faithful, and the Sikh
cavalry shown a better front, the day would have been
won, in spite of an immense disparity in numbers. But
the Oude artillerymen and drivers were traitors. They
overturned the guns into ditches, cut the traces of their
horses, and abandoned them, regardless of the remonstrances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
and exertions of their own officers, and of those
of Sir Henry Lawrence's staff, headed by the Brigadier-General
in person, who himself drew his sword upon
these rebels. Every effort to induce them to stand
having proved ineffectual, the force, exposed to a vastly
superior fire of artillery, and completely outflanked on
both sides by an overpowering body of infantry and
cavalry, which actually got into our rear, was compelled
to retire with the loss of three pieces of artillery, which
fell into the hands of the enemy, in consequence of the rank
treachery of the Oude gunners, and with a very grievous
list of killed and wounded. The heat was dreadful, the
gun ammunition was expended, and the almost total
want of cavalry to protect our rear made our retreat
most disastrous.</p>

<p>All the officers behaved well, and the exertions of the
small body of Volunteer Cavalry&mdash;only forty in number&mdash;under
Captain Radcliffe, 7th Light Cavalry, were most
praiseworthy. Sir Henry Lawrence subsequently conveyed
his thanks to myself, who had, at his request, accompanied
him upon this occasion (Colonel Case being
in command of Her Majesty's 32nd). He also expressed
his approbation of the way in which his Staff&mdash;Captain
Wilson, officiating deputy assistant adjutant-general;
Lieutenant James, sub-assistant commissary-general; Captain
Edgel, officiating military secretary; and Mr. Couper,
C.S.&mdash;the last of whom had acted as Sir Henry Lawrence's
A.D.C. from the commencement of the disturbances,&mdash;had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
conducted themselves throughout this arduous
day. Sir Henry further particularly mentioned that he
would bring the gallant conduct of Captain Radcliffe and
of Lieutenant Bonham, of the Artillery, (who worked the
howitzer successfully until incapacitated by a wound,) to
the prominent notice of the Government of India. The
manner in which Lieutenant Birch, 71st Native Infantry,
cleared a village with a party of Sikh skirmishes, also
elicited the admiration of the Brigadier-General. The
conduct of Lieutenant Hardinge, who, with his handful of
horse, covered the retreat of the rear-guard, was extolled
by Sir Henry, who expressed his intention of mentioning
the services of this gallant officer to his Lordship in
Council. Lieutenant-Colonel Case, who commanded Her
Majesty's 32nd Regiment, was mortally wounded whilst
gallantly leading on his men. The service had not a more
deserving officer. The command devolved on Captain
Steevens, who also received a death-wound shortly afterwards.
The command then fell to Captain Mansfield,
who has since died of cholera.</p>

<p>It will be in the recollection of his Lordship in Council
that it was the original intention of Sir Henry Lawrence
to occupy not only the Residency, but also the fort called
Muchee Bhawun&mdash;an old dilapidated edifice, which had
been hastily repaired for the occasion, though the defences
were, even at the last moment, very far from complete,
and were, moreover, commanded by many houses in the
city. The situation of the Muchee Bhawun, with regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
to the Residency, has already been described to the Government
of India.</p>

<p>The untoward event of June the 30th so far diminished
the whole available force that we had not a sufficient
number of men remaining to occupy both positions. The
Brigadier-General, therefore, on the evening of July the
1st signalled to the garrison of the Muchee Bhawun to
evacuate and blow up that fortress in the course of the
night. The orders were ably carried out, and at 12 <small>P.M.</small>
the force marched into the Residency, with their guns and
treasure, without the loss of a man; and shortly afterwards
the explosion of 240 barrels of gunpowder and
6,000,000 ball cartridges, which were lying in the magazine,
announced to Sir Henry Lawrence and his officers,
who were anxiously awaiting the report, the complete
destruction of that post and all that it contained. If it
had not been for this wise and strategic measure, no
member of the Lucknow garrison, in all probability,
would have survived to tell the tale; for, as has already
been stated, the Muchee Bhawun was commanded from
other parts of the town, and was, moreover, indifferently
provided with heavy artillery ammunition; while the
difficulty, suffering, and loss which the Residency garrison,
even with the reinforcement thus obtained from the
Muchee Bhawun, has undergone in holding the position,
is sufficient to show that if the original intention of holding
both posts had been adhered to, both would have
inevitably fallen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
It is now my very painful duty to relate the calamity
which befell us at the commencement of the siege. On
the 1st July an 8-inch shell burst in the room in the
Residency in which Sir H. Lawrence was sitting. The
missile burst between him and Mr. Couper, close to both;
but without injury to either. The whole of his staff
implored Sir Henry to take up other quarters, as the
Residency had then become the special target for the
round shot and shell of the enemy. This, however, he
jestingly declined to do, observing that another shell
would certainly never be pitched into that small room.
But Providence had ordained otherwise, for on the very
next day he was mortally wounded by the fragment of
another shell which burst in the same room exactly at
the same spot. Captain Wilson, deputy assistant adjutant-general,
received a contusion at the same time.</p>

<p>The late lamented Sir H. Lawrence, knowing that his
last hour was rapidly approaching, directed me to assume
command of the troops, and appointed Major Banks to
succeed him in the office of Chief Commissioner. He
lingered in great agony till the morning of the 4th July,
when he expired, and the Government was thereby deprived,
if I may venture to say so, of the services of a
distinguished statesman and a most gallant soldier. Few
men have ever possessed to the same extent the power he
enjoyed of winning the hearts of all those with whom he
came in contact, and thus ensuring the warmest and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
most zealous devotion for himself and for the Government
which he served. The successful defence of the
position has been, under Providence, solely attributable
to the foresight which he evinced in the timely commencement
of the necessary operations, and the great
skill and untiring personal activity which he exhibited in
carrying them into effect. All ranks possessed such confidence
in his judgment and his fertility of resource, that
the news of his fall was received throughout the garrison
with feelings of consternation only second to the grief
which was inspired in the hearts of all by the loss of a
public benefactor and a warm personal friend. Feeling
as keenly and as gratefully as I do the obligations that
the whole of us are under to this great and good man, I
trust the Government of India will pardon me for having
attempted, however imperfectly, to portray them. In
him every good and deserving soldier lost a friend and a
chief capable of discriminating, and ever on the alert to
reward merit, no matter how humble the sphere in which
it was exhibited.</p>

<p>The garrison had scarcely recovered the shock which
it had sustained in the loss of its revered and beloved
General, when it had to mourn the death of that able and
respected officer, Major Banks, the officiating chief commissioner,
who received a bullet through his head while
examining a critical outpost on the 21st July, and died
without a groan. The description of our position, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
the state of our defences when the siege began, are so
fully set forth in the memorandum furnished by the
garrison engineer, that I shall content myself with bringing
to the notice of his Lordship in Council the fact that when
the blockade was commenced, only two of our batteries
were completed, part of the defences were yet in an unfinished
condition, and the buildings in the immediate
vicinity, which gave cover to the enemy, were only
very partially cleared away. Indeed, our heaviest losses
have been caused by the fire from the enemy's sharp-shooters
stationed in the adjoining mosques and houses of
the native nobility, the necessity of destroying which had
been repeatedly drawn to the attention of Sir Henry by
the staff of engineers. But his invariable reply was,
"Spare the holy places, and private property too, as much
as possible;" and we have consequently suffered severely
from our very tenderness to the religious prejudices
and respect to the rights of our rebellious citizens and
soldiery. As soon as the enemy had thoroughly completed
the investment of the Residency, they occupied
these houses, some of which were within easy pistol-shot
of our barricades, in immense force, and rapidly made
loopholes on those sides which bore on our post, from
which they kept up a terrific and incessant fire day
and night, which caused many daily casualties, as there
could not have been less than 8,000 men firing at
one time into our position. Moreover, there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
place in the whole of our works that could be considered
safe, for several of the sick and wounded who were lying
in the banqueting hall, which had been turned into a
hospital, were killed in the very centre of the building,
and the widow of Lieutenant Dorin and other women
and children were shot dead in rooms into which it had
not been previously deemed possible that a bullet could
penetrate. Neither were the enemy idle in erecting batteries.
They soon had from twenty to twenty-five guns
in position, some of them of very large calibre. These
were planted all round our post at small distances, some
being actually within fifty yards of our defences, but in
places where our own heavy guns could not reply to
them, while the perseverance and ingenuity of the enemy
in erecting barricades in front of, and around, their guns
in a very short time, rendered all attempts to silence them
by musketry unavailing. Neither could they be effectually
silenced by shells, by reason of their extreme
proximity to our position, and because, moreover, the
enemy had recourse to digging very narrow trenches
about eight feet in depth in rear of each gun, in which
the men lay while our shells were flying, and which so
effectually concealed them, even while working the gun,
that our baffled sharp-shooters could only see their hands
while in the act of loading.</p>

<p>The enemy contented themselves with keeping up this
incessant fire of cannon and musketry until the 20th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
July, on which day, at 10 <small>A.M.</small>, they assembled in very
great force all round our position, and exploded a heavy
mine inside our outer line of defences at the Water
Gate. The mine, however, which was close to the
Redan, and apparently sprung with the intention of
destroying that battery, did no harm. But as soon as
the smoke had cleared away, the enemy boldly advanced
under cover of a tremendous fire of cannon and musketry,
with the object of storming the Redan. But they were
received with such a heavy fire, that after a short
struggle they fell back with much loss. A strong
column advanced at the same time to attack Innes' post,
and came on to within ten yards of the palisades, affording
to Lieutenant Loughnan, 13th Native Infantry, who
commanded the position, and his brave garrison, composed
of gentlemen of the Uncovenanted Service, a few of
Her Majesty's 32nd Foot and the 13th Native Infantry,
an opportunity of distinguishing themselves, which they
were not slow to avail themselves of, and the enemy
were driven back with great slaughter. The insurgents
made minor attacks at almost every outpost, but were
invariably defeated, and at 2 <small>P.M.</small> they ceased their
attempts to storm the place, although their musketry fire
and cannonading continued to harass us unceasingly as
usual. Matters proceeded in this manner until the 10th
August, when the enemy made another assault, having previously
sprung a mine close to the brigade mess, which entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
destroyed our defences for the space of twenty feet,
and blew in a great portion of the outside wall of the
house occupied by Mr. Shilling's garrison. On the dust
clearing away, a breach appeared, through which a regiment
could have advanced in perfect order, and a few of
the enemy came on with the utmost determination, but
were met with such a withering flank fire of musketry
from the officers and men holding the top of the brigade
mess, that they beat a speedy retreat, leaving the
more adventurous of their numbers lying on the crest of
the breach. While this operation was going on, another
large body advanced on the Cawnpore battery, and succeeded
in locating themselves for a few minutes in the
ditch. They were, however, dislodged by hand-grenades.
At Captain Anderson's post they also came boldly forward
with scaling ladders, which they planted against the wall;
but here, as elsewhere, they were met with the most indomitable
resolution, and the leaders being slain, the rest fled,
leaving the ladders, and retreated to their batteries and
loopholed defences, from whence they kept up, for the rest
of the day, an unusually heavy cannonade and musketry
fire. On the 18th August the enemy sprang another
mine in front of the Sikh lines with very fatal effect.
Captain Orr (unattached), Lieutenants Mecham and
Soppitt, who commanded the small body of drummers
composing the garrison, were blown into the air; but
providentially returned to earth with no further injury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
than a severe shaking. The garrison, however, were not
so fortunate. No less than eleven men were buried alive
under the ruins, from whence it was impossible to extricate
them, owing to the tremendous fire kept up by the
enemy from houses situated not ten yards in front of the
breach. The explosion was followed by a general assault
of a less determined nature than the two former
efforts, and the enemy were consequently repulsed without
much difficulty. But they succeeded, under cover of
the breach, in establishing themselves in one of the houses
in our position, from which they were driven in the
evening by the bayonets of Her Majesty's 32nd and 84th
Foot. On the 5th of September the enemy made their
last serious assault. Having exploded a large mine, a
few feet short of the bastion of the 18-pounder gun, in
Major Apthorp's post, they advanced with large heavy
scaling ladders, which they planted against the wall, and
mounted, thereby gaining for an instant the embrasure of
a gun. They were, however, speedily driven back with
loss by hand-grenades and musketry. A few minutes
subsequently they sprung another mine close to the brigade
mess, and advanced boldly; but soon the corpses
strewed in the garden in front of the post bore testimony
to the fatal accuracy of the rifle and musketry fire of the
gallant members of that garrison, and the enemy fed
ignominiously, leaving their leader&mdash;a fine-looking old
native officer&mdash;among the slain. At other posts they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
made similar attacks, but with less resolution, and everywhere
with the same want of success. Their loss upon
this day must have been very heavy, as they came on
with much determination, and at night they were seen
bearing large numbers of their killed and wounded over
the bridges in the direction of cantonments.</p>

<p>The above is a faint attempt at a description of the four
great struggles which have occurred during this protracted
season of exertion, exposure, and suffering. His
Lordship in Council will perceive that the enemy invariably
commenced his attacks by the explosion of a mine,&mdash;a
species of offensive warfare, for the exercise of which
our position was unfortunately peculiarly situated; and
had it not been for the most untiring vigilance on our
part, in watching and blowing up their mines before they
were completed, the assaults would probably have been
much more numerous, and might, perhaps, have ended in
the capture of the place. But by countermining in all
directions, we succeeded in detecting and destroying no
less than four of the enemy's subterraneous advances
towards important positions, two of which operations were
eminently successful, as on one occasion not less than
eighty of them were blown into the air, and twenty
suffered a similar fate on the second explosion. The
labour, however, which devolved upon us in making
these counter-mines, in the absence of a body of skilled
miners, was very heavy. The Right Honourable the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
Governor-General in Council will feel that it would be
impossible to crowd, within the limits of a despatch, even
the principal events, much more the individual acts of
gallantry, which have marked this protracted struggle.
But I can conscientiously declare my conviction, that
few troops have ever undergone greater hardships, exposed
as they have been to a never-ceasing musketry fire
and cannonade. They have also experienced the alternate
vicissitudes of extreme wet and intense heat, and
that too with very insufficient shelter from either, and in
many places without any shelter at all. In addition to
having to repel real attacks, they have been exposed
night and day to the hardly less harassing false alarms
which the enemy have been constantly raising. The
insurgents have frequently fired very heavily, sounded
the advance, and shouted for several hours together,
though not a man could be seen, with the view, of course,
of harassing our small and exhausted force; in which
object they succeeded, for no part has been strong enough
to allow of a portion only of the garrison being prepared
in the event of a false attack being turned into a real one.
All, therefore, had to stand to their arms, and to remain
at their posts until the demonstration had ceased; and
such attacks were of almost nightly occurrence. The
whole of the officers and men have been on duty night
and day during the eighty-seven days which the siege
had lasted, up to the arrival of Sir J. Outram, G.C.B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
In addition to this incessant military duty, the force
has been nightly employed in repairing defences, in
moving guns, in burying dead animals, in conveying ammunition
and commissariat stores from one place to
another, and in other fatigue duties too numerous and too
trivial to enumerate here. I feel, however, that any
words of mine will fail to convey any adequate idea of
what our fatigue and labours have been&mdash;labours in
which all ranks and all classes, civilians, officers, and
soldiers, have all borne an equally noble part. All have
together descended into the mine; all have together
handled the shovel for the interment of the putrid bullock;
and all, accoutred with musket and bayonet, have
relieved each other on sentry, without regard to the distinctions
of rank, civil or military. Notwithstanding all
these hardships, the garrison has made no less than five
sorties, in which they spiked two of the enemy's heaviest
guns, and blew up several of the houses from which they
had kept up the most harassing fire. Owing to the
extreme paucity of our numbers, each man was taught to
feel that on his own individual efforts alone depended in
no small measure the safety of the entire position. This
consciousness incited every officer, soldier, and man to
defend the post assigned to him with such desperate
tenacity, and fight for the lives which Providence had
intrusted to his care with such dauntless determination,
that the enemy, despite their constant attacks, their heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
mines, their overwhelming numbers, and their incessant
fire, could never succeed in gaining one inch of
ground within the bounds of this straggling position,
which was so feebly fortified, that had they once obtained
a footing in any of the outposts, the whole place must
inevitably have fallen.</p>

<p>If further proof be wanting of the desperate nature of
the struggle which we have, under God's blessing, so long
and so successfully waged, I would point to the roofless and
ruined houses, to the crumpled walls, to the exploded mines,
to the open breaches, to the shattered and disabled guns
and defences, and lastly to the long and melancholy list of
the brave and devoted officers and men who have fallen.
These silent witnesses bear sad and solemn testimony to
the way in which this feeble position has been defended.
During the early part of these vicissitudes, we were
left without any information whatever regarding the
posture of affairs outside. An occasional spy did indeed
come in with the object of inducing our sepoys and servants
to desert; but the intelligence derived from such
sources was, of course, entirely untrustworthy. We sent
our messengers, daily calling for aid and asking for information,
none of whom ever returned until the 26th
day of the siege, when a pensioner named Ungud
came back with a letter from General Havelock's camp,
informing us that they were advancing with a force
sufficient to bear down all opposition, and would be with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
us in five or six days. A messenger was immediately
despatched, requesting that on the evening of their arrival
on the outskirts of the city, two rockets might be sent
up, in order that we might take the necessary measures
for assisting them in forcing their way in. The sixth
day, however, expired, and they came not; but for many
evenings after officers and men watched for the ascension
of the expected rockets, with hopes such as make the
heart sick. We knew not then, nor did we learn until
the 29th of August&mdash;or thirty-five days later&mdash;that the
relieving force, after having fought most nobly to effect
our deliverance, had been obliged to fall back for reinforcements,
and this was the last communication we
received until two days before the arrival of Sir James
Outram on Sept. 25th.</p>

<p>Besides heavy visitations of cholera and smallpox, we
have also had to contend against a sickness which has
almost universally pervaded the garrison. Commencing
with a very painful eruption it has merged into a low
fever, combined with diarrh&oelig;a; and although few or no
men have actually died from its effects, it leaves behind a
weakness and lassitude which, in the absence of all material
sustenance, save coarse beef and still coarser flour,
none have been able entirely to get over. The mortality
among the women and children, and especially among the
latter, from these diseases and from other causes, has been
perhaps the most characteristic of the siege. The want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
of native servants has also been a source of much privation.
Owing to the suddenness with which we were
besieged, many of these people who might perhaps have
otherwise proved faithful to their employers, but who
were outside of the defences at the time, were altogether
excluded. Very many more deserted, and several families
were consequently left without the services of a single
domestic. Several ladies have had to tend their children,
and even to wash their own clothes, as well as to cook
their scanty meals entirely unaided. Combined with the
absence of servants, the want of proper accommodation
has probably been the cause of much of the disease with
which we have been afflicted. I cannot refrain from
bringing to the prominent notice of his Lordship in Council
the patient endurance and the Christian resignation
which have been evinced by the women of this garrison.
They have animated us by their example. Many, alas!
have been made widows and their children fatherless in
this cruel struggle. But all such seem resigned to the
will of Providence, and many, among whom may be mentioned
the honoured names of Birch, of Polehampton, of
Barbor, and of Gall, have, after the example of Miss
Nightingale, constituted themselves the tender and solicitous
nurses of the wounded and dying soldiers in the
hospital.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to bring to the favourable notice
of his Lordship in Council the names of those officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
who have most distinguished themselves, and afforded me
the most valuable assistance in these operations. Many of
the best and bravest of these now rest from their labours.
Among them are Lieutenant-Colonel Case and Captain
Radcliffe, whose services have already been narrated.
Captain Francis, 13th Native Infantry&mdash;who was killed
by a round shot&mdash;had particularly attracted the attention
of Sir H. Lawrence for his conduct while in command of
the Muchee Bhawun; Captain Fulton, of the Engineers,
who also was struck by a round shot, had, up to the time
of his early and lamented death, afforded me the most invaluable
aid; he was indeed indefatigable; Major Anderson,
the chief Engineer, though, from the commencement
of the siege, incapable of physical exertion from the
effects of the disease under which he eventually sank,
merited my warm acknowledgments for his able counsel.
Captain Simons, commandant of artillery, distinguished
himself at Chinhut, where he received the two wounds
which ended in his death; Lieutenants Shepherd and
Arthur, 7th Light Cavalry, who were killed at their
posts; Captain Hughes, 57th Native Infantry, who was
mortally wounded at the capture of a house which formed
one of the enemy's outposts; Captain M'Cabe, of the
32nd Foot, who was killed at the head of his men while
leading his fourth sortie, as well as Captain Mansfield, of
the same corps, who died of cholera&mdash;were all officers who
had distinguished themselves highly. Mr. Lucas too, a
gentleman volunteer, and Mr. Boyson, of the Uncovenanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
Service&mdash;who fell when on the look-out at one
of the most perilous outposts&mdash;had earned themselves
reputations for coolness and gallantry.</p>

<p>The officers who commanded outposts&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel
Master, 7th Light Cavalry; Major Apthorp,
and Captain Sanders, 41st Native Infantry; Captain
Boileau, 7th Light Cavalry; Captain Germon, 13th
Native Infantry; Lieutenant Aitkin, and Lieutenant
Loughnan, of the same corps; Captain Anderson, 25th
Native Infantry; Lieutenant Graydon, 44th Native
Infantry; Lieutenant Langmore, 71st Native Infantry;
and Mr. Schilling, principal of the Martiniere College&mdash;have
all conducted ably the duties of their onerous
position. No further proof of this is necessary than the
fact which I have before mentioned, that throughout the
whole duration of the siege, the enemy were not only
unable to take, but they could not even succeed in
gaining, one inch of the posts commanded by these gallant
gentlemen. Colonel Master commanded the critical and
important post of the brigade mess, on either side of
which was an open breach, only flanked by his handful
of riflemen and musketeers. Lieutenant Aitkin, with the
whole of the 13th Native Infantry, which remained to us
with the exception of their Sikhs, commanded the Baillie
Guard&mdash;perhaps the most important position in the
whole of the defences; and Lieutenant Langmore, with
the remnant of his regiment (the 71st), held a very exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
position between the Hospital and the Water
Gate. This gallant and deserving young soldier and his
men were entirely without shelter from the weather, both
by night and by day.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to Lieutenants Anderson,
Hutchinson, and Innes, of the Engineers, as well as
Lieutenant Tulloch, 58th Native Infantry, and Lieutenant
Hay, 48th Native Infantry, who were placed under
them to aid in the arduous duties devolving upon that
department. Lieutenant Thomas, Madras Artillery, who
commanded that arm of the service for some weeks, and
Lieutenants Macfarlane and Bonham, rendered me the
most effectual assistance. I was, however, deprived of
the services of the two latter, who were wounded,
Lieutenant Bonham no less than three times, early in the
siege. Captain Evans, 17th Bombay Native Infantry, who,
owing to the scarcity of artillery officers, was put in
charge of some guns, was ever to be found at his post.</p>

<p>Major Lowe, commanding Her Majesty's 32nd Regiment;
Captain Bassano, Lieutenants Lawrence, Edmonstoune,
Foster, Harmar, Cooke, Clery, Browne, and
Charlton, of that corps, have all nobly performed their
duty. Every one of these officers, with the exception of
Lieutenants Lawrence and Clery, have received one or
more wounds of more or less severity. Quartermaster
Stribbling, of the same corps, also conducted himself to
my satisfaction.</p>

<p>Captain O'Brien, Her Majesty's 84th Foot; Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
Kemble, 41st Native Infantry; Captain Edgell, 53rd
Native Infantry; Captain Dinning, Lieutenant Sewell,
and Lieutenant Worsley, of the 71st Native Infantry;
Lieutenant Warner, 7th Local Corps; Ensign Ward, 48th
Native Infantry (who, when most of our artillery officers
were killed or disabled, worked the mortars with excellent
effect); Lieutenant Graham, 11th Native Infantry;
Lieutenant Mecham, 4th Oude Locals; and Lieutenant
Keir, 41st Native Infantry, have all done good and willing
service throughout the siege, and I trust that they will
receive the favourable notice of his Lordship in Council.</p>

<p>I beg particularly to call the attention of the Government
of India to the untiring industry, the extreme
devotion, and the great skill which have been evinced by
Surgeon Scott (superintending surgeon), and Assistant-surgeon
Boyd, of Her Majesty's 32nd Foot; Assistant-surgeon
Bird, of the Artillery; Surgeon Campbell, 7th Light
Cavalry; Surgeon Brydon, 7th Native Infantry; Surgeon
Ogilvie, sanitary commissioner; Assistant-surgeon Fayrer,
civil surgeon; Assistant-surgeon Partridge, 2nd Oude
Irregular Cavalry; Assistant-surgeon Greenhow; Assistant-surgeon
Darby, and by Mr. Apothecary Thompson, in
the discharge of their onerous and most important duties.</p>

<p>Messrs. Thornhill and Capper, of the Civil Service,
have been both wounded, and the way in which they, as
well as Mr. Martin, the deputy commissioner of Lucknow,
conducted themselves, entitles them to a place in this
despatch. Captain Carnegie, the special assistant commissioner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
whose invaluable service previous to the commencement
of the siege I have frequently heard warmly
dilated upon, both by Sir H. Lawrence and by Major Banks,
and whose exertions will probably be more amply brought
to notice by the civil authorities on some future occasion,
has conducted the office of provost marshal to my satisfaction.
The Reverend Mr. Harris and the Reverend
Mr. Polehampton, assistant chaplains, vied with each
other in their untiring care and attention to the suffering
men. The latter gentleman was wounded in the hospital,
and subsequently unhappily died of cholera. Mr. M'Crae,
of the Civil Engineers, did excellent service, at the guns,
until he was severely wounded. Mr. Cameron, also, a
gentleman who had come to Oude to inquire into the
resources of the country, acquired the whole mystery of
mortar practice, and was of the most signal service until
incapacitated by sickness. Mr. Marshall, of the road
department, and other members of the Uncovenanted
Service, whose names will, on a subsequent occasion, be
laid before the Government of India, conducted themselves
bravely and steadily. Indeed, the entire body of
these gentlemen have borne themselves well, and have
evinced great coolness under fire.</p>

<p>I have now only to bring to the notice of the Right
Honourable the Governor-General in Council the conduct
of the several officers who composed my staff:&mdash;Lieutenant
James, sub-assistant commissary-general, was
severely wounded by a shot through the knee at Chinhut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
notwithstanding which he refused to go upon the
sick list, and carried on his most trying duties throughout
the entire siege. It is not too much to say that the
garrison owe their lives to the exertions and firmness of
this officer. Before the struggle commenced, he was
ever in the saddle, getting in supplies, and his untiring
vigilance in their distribution after our difficulties had
begun, prevented a waste which otherwise, long before
the expiration of the eighty-seven days, might have annihilated
the force by the slow process of starvation.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson, 13th Native Infantry, officiating deputy-assistant
adjutant-general, was ever to be found
where shot was flying thickest; and I am at a loss to
decide whether his services were more invaluable owing
to the untiring physical endurance and bravery which
he displayed, or to his ever-ready and pertinent counsel
and advice in moments of difficulty and danger.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hardinge, an officer whose achievements
and antecedents are well known to the Government of
India, has earned fresh laurels by his conduct throughout
the siege. He was officiating as deputy-assistant quartermaster-general,
and also commanded the Sikh portion of
the cavalry of the garrison. In both capacities his services
have been invaluable, especially in the latter, for it
was owing alone to his tact, vigilance, and bravery, that
the Sikh horsemen were induced to persevere in holding
a very unprotected post under a heavy fire.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Barwell, 71st Native Infantry, the fort adjutant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
and officiating major of brigade, has proved himself
to be an efficient officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Birch, of the 71st Native Infantry, has
been my aide-de-camp throughout the siege. I firmly
believe there never was a better aide-de-camp. He has
been indefatigable, and ever ready to lead a sortie, or to
convey an order to a threatened outpost under the heaviest
fire. On one of these occasions he received a slight wound
on the head. I beg to bring the services of this most
promising and intelligent young officer to the favourable
consideration of his Lordship in Council.</p>

<p>I am also much indebted to Mr. Cooper, Civil Service,
for the assistance he has on many occasions afforded me
by his judicious advice. I have, moreover, ever found
him most ready and willing in the performance of the
military duties assigned to him, however exposed the post
or arduous the undertaking. He commenced his career
in Her Majesty's service, and consequently had had some
previous experience of military matters. If the road to
Cawnpore had been made clear by the advent of our
troops, it was my intention to have deputed this officer to
Calcutta, to detail in person the occurrences which have
taken place, for the information of the Government of
India. I still hope that when our communications shall
be once more unopposed he may be summoned to Calcutta
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have the pleasure of bringing the splendid
behaviour of the soldiers, viz., the men of Her Majesty's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
32nd Foot, the small detachment of Her Majesty's 84th
Foot, the European and Native Artillery, the 13th, 48th,
and 71st Regiments of Native Infantry, and the Sikhs
of the respective corps, to the notice of the Government
of India. The losses sustained by Her Majesty's 32nd,
which is now barely 300 strong; by Her Majesty's 84th,
and by the European Artillery, show at least that they
knew how to die in the cause of their countrymen.
Their conduct under the fire, the exposure, and the
privations which they had to undergo, has been throughout
most admirable and praiseworthy.</p>

<p>As another instance of the desperate character of our
defence, and the difficulties we have had to contend with,
I may mention that the number of our artillerymen was
so reduced that on the occasion of an attack, the gunners,
aided as they were by men of Her Majesty's 32nd Foot,
and by volunteers of all classes, had to run from one
battery to another, wherever the fire of the enemy was
hottest, there not being nearly enough men to serve half
the number of guns at the same time. In short, at last,
the number of European gunners was only twenty-four,
while we had, including mortars, no less than thirty guns
in position.</p>

<p>With respect to the native troops, I am of opinion that
their loyalty has never been surpassed. They were indifferently
fed and worse housed. They were exposed&mdash;especially
the 13th Regiment&mdash;under the gallant Lieutenant
Aitken, to a most galling fire of round shot and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
musketry, which materially decreased their numbers.
They were so near the enemy that conversation could be
carried on between them; and every effort, persuasion,
promise, and threat was alternately resorted to, in vain, to
seduce them from their allegiance to the handful of Europeans,
who, in all probability, would have been sacrificed
by their desertion. All the troops behaved nobly, and
the names of those men of the native force who have particularly
distinguished themselves, have been laid before
Major-General Sir James Outram, G.C.B., who has
promised to promote them. Those of the European force
will be transmitted in due course for the orders of His
Royal Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I beg leave to express, on the part of
myself and the members of this garrison, our deep and
grateful sense of the conduct of Major-General Sir J.
Outram, G.C.B.; of Brigadier-General Havelock, C.B.,
and of the troops under those officers who so devotedly
came to our relief at so heavy a sacrifice of life.
We are also repaid for much suffering and privation by
the sympathy which our brave deliverers say our perilous
and unfortunate position has excited for us in the hearts
of our countrymen throughout the length and breadth of
Her Majesty's dominions.&mdash;I have, &amp;c.,</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
